SEEKING A CLUE</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">HARVEY HAMILTON, the young aviator,
found himself in the most distressful dilemma
of his life. He and his devoted friend,
the colored youth Bohunkus Johnson, had left their
homes near the New Jersey village of Mootsport,
and sailing away in the former&#8217;s aeroplane had
run into a series of adventures in eastern Pennsylvania,
which have been related in &#8220;The Flying
Boys in the Sky.&#8221; It was the good fortune of
Harvey to help in the recovery of the little girl who
was kidnapped from her home in Philadelphia
some weeks before. All having gone well down to
the time of her rescue, he was awaiting the return
of &#8220;Bunk&#8221; to continue their outing, when to his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
consternation he learned that his dusky comrade
had gone off with Professor Milo Morgan in his
unique monoplane, which bore the fantastic name
&#8220;The Dragon of the Skies.&#8221; To add to the annoyance
of the situation, the couple had started on
the maddest enterprise of which a mortal has ever
been guilty,&mdash;a trip across the Atlantic Ocean to
the continent of Africa. That fact of itself would
have stamped the gaunt, grizzled aviator as the
veriest lunatic outside of a hospital for the insane.</p>

<p>Two remembrances caused Harvey Hamilton
keen regret: one was his hasty words to Bunk,
which were the indirect cause of this astounding
venture, and the other his failure to warn him of
the mental weakness of Professor Morgan. Had
he done as he ought to have done, in either instance,
the lad would have been saved from the terrifying
peril into which he had rushed.</p>

<p>But while our young friend condemned himself
without stint, it was now too late for mere grief.
The momentous question was whether he could
do anything to save Bunk, and if so, how should he
go about it?</p>

<p>The Dragon of the Skies was not only much
swifter than his biplane, but it had a start of at
least two days. If the owner had headed for the
Dark Continent, he was already well advanced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
upon the fateful journey. In that event Harvey
could do nothing but wait through the long days
and weeks for the news that might never come to
him.</p>

<p>The more he strode up and down the hotel
porch and thought of the matter, the more he was
puzzled. He must attempt nothing without good
counsel and the best man to give it was Simmons
Pendar, the detective, who had been the means
of rescuing little Grace Hastings from the band of
kidnappers. Although inaction was torture, he
stayed in Chesterton, with his aeroplane in the
primitive hangar, until Pendar, having finished
the rush of business, found time to greet him.
When Harvey asked him for a few minutes, the
officer, who naturally was in high spirits, replied
in his hearty manner:</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear boy, you shall have all the time you
want; I can never forget the obligations under
which you have placed the Hastings and me; let
me know how I can serve you.&#8221;</p>

<p>They seated themselves at the farther end of
the porch, beyond earshot of eavesdroppers and
talked in low tones. It took Harvey only a short
time to tell his story. The detective whistled
softly when he finished.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, this is a peculiar situation indeed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
Neither of us ever dreamed of anything of the kind.
You are asking yourself whether you can do anything
to help your friend?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it possible for me to lift a hand for him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s mighty little comfort in those words,
Mr. Pendar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would it cheer you more if I said there was no
hope at all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid it would not make much difference
in my feelings. I cannot remain idle, but I don&#8217;t
know which way to turn or what to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>The detective proved his power of quick thinking
and of concentrating his faculties upon any
theme that might claim them, by saying in his positive
manner:</p>

<p>&#8220;In the first place, I don&#8217;t believe Professor
Morgan has started for Africa.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harvey Hamilton almost sprang from his chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you say that, after what we have
learned?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I may be wrong, but I am strongly of the opinion
that while he has in mind such a trip he isn&#8217;t
prepared to try it just yet. No mistake about it,
he is a wonderful inventor. He has already done
enough to make him wealthy and famous. He
courses through the air without noise; he can go<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
straight aloft by means of his uplifter, which
enables him to hover stationary like a bird over
any spot he selects. From a remark I once heard
him make, I believe the great idea upon which he
is working is that of drawing electricity from the
air and using it as motive power. When he is
able to do that&mdash;and who shall say that he will
not solve the problem very soon?&mdash;he can stay
aloft indefinitely; that is, until he uses up his supply
of food and oil.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has already formulated a chemical composition
that will keep him aloft for half a day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not long enough to cross the Atlantic. He is
figuring on his scheme now, and time and experiment
are necessary for him to reach success.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is likely to make a mistake, is he not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Being human, though crazy, he will do that.
But there is a method in his madness. Having
accomplished several remarkable things, he has
proved that thus far all has gone right with him.
Now, my dear boy, while he is sure he will sooner
or later cross the Atlantic, he will not start till
he is ready and his machine fit. Therefore, I
repeat that days and perhaps weeks will pass before
he makes the attempt of which other aviators are
still dreaming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what will he do in the meantime?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>Detective Pendar shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Experiment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You encourage me by what you say, but from
what point is he likely to start?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally where the width of the ocean is
narrowest. He will not leave the New Jersey or
New York or New England coast, but in my
judgment will bid North America good-bye at
Quebec or its neighborhood and head directly
eastward for Liverpool.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the distance between those two cities?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty-six hundred miles. Say he can
average seventy-five miles an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>The detective did a little mental figuring.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he can do that and has no accident, he will
reach Liverpool in one day and a half after leaving
Quebec. If he can make a hundred miles an
hour&mdash;and depend upon it the aviators of the near
future will surpass that speed&mdash;he can bid Canada
good-bye in the afternoon and watch the sun set
in England on the following day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When at Liverpool he will still be a long way
from Africa.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the after trip will be mainly by land.
The Channel has already been frequently crossed
by air men and when he follows suit he will be
on the continent. Then it will be a pleasing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
excursion southward over France and Spain to
Gibraltar, from which it is only a step to Africa.
Have you any idea in what part of the Dark Continent
your colored friend expects to find his distinguished
parent?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no more idea than he has himself, but
I should think it is well to the south.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That route would take him through Morocco,
Rio de Oro, Senegal, to Liberia, with the larger
half of Africa still to the southward. But it is
idle to speculate on their course after crossing the
ocean, a feat they are not likely to accomplish for
some time to come. Let us figure on what they
will probably do while in our own country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the great question. If we can&#8217;t head off
the lunatic and rescue poor Bunk before he turns
his back upon these shores he will never be rescued
at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Professor Morgan is a moody man. Only on
rare occasions does he come out of his shell, as he
did on the night when he first called upon you at
the home of the countryman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When we met afterward he was hardly willing
to look at, much less speak to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is his natural frame of mind; now and
then the reaction hits him, when he will admit
there are other human beings on our earth. It is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
useless, therefore, to look for the Professor in any
of the cities or towns. He will not share his
secrets with others, but will push his investigations
in private and far from the haunts of men. I believe
he will locate somewhere to the northward,
either in the mountainous regions of New York,
New England or Canada, so that when he is prepared,
he will have only a short distance to go to
get to his starting point. But,&#8221; added Detective
Pendar, &#8220;we are in the realm of guesswork and
that part of the earth lying yonder&#8221; (he made a
sweep of his arm to the northward) &#8220;is pretty big.
Of course you will never find him without first
picking up some clue.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how shall that be done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I wish I could answer.&#8221;</p>

<p>The detective lighted another cigar, leaned back
in his chair with his legs crossed and puffed awhile
in silence. He was thinking hard and his listener
waited for him to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been trying to decide upon what fact I
base a vague belief that this loon has his workshop
in the northern part of New York State, well
toward the Canadian border. He never told me
anything about himself and I have not seen his
name or doings in print. The impression must be
one of those hazy ones that steal into the brain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
without any apparent reason, and are explained by
some as due to a sixth sense.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Such as when you located the kidnappers in
this part of the world,&#8221; ventured Harvey Hamilton.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was quite different; I accidentally ran
upon a definite clue, but there is nothing of the
kind in sight here. You have no idea how many
of the successes among us detectives are due to
lucky accidents. Now such an original genius as
Milo Morgan cannot always keep out of the public
eye. His achievements are so remarkable that
several of them must become known; the omni-present
reporters will hunt him up; if they can get
snapshots his picture will appear on the printed
page, with interesting interviews, all probably
faked. If this does not occur, his doings will be
mentioned in some journal; if you will arrange with
a press-clipping bureau, you will probably get the
clue you need.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harvey had never thought of anything like this.
It added to his hopefulness and he began to believe
it quite possible that Bohunkus Johnson might
be run down and saved from what seemed impending
death.</p>

<p>&#8220;The character of Professor Morgan being
what it is, why was he willing to take my colored
friend with him?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>&#8220;It was not altogether the whim of a lunatic.
He could not have failed to note that the negro is
stupid, consequently would not bore him with
questions which he did not wish to answer. At
the same time, Bunk is big, powerful and good-natured,&mdash;in
short an ideal assistant, for there must
be arduous labor connected with the experiments
of the brilliant inventor. In my judgment it was
these facts which influenced Morgan to take the
lad with him; Bunk would be desirable for the
same reasons on a trip across the ocean and it
would be an easy reward to give him for his
help.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me, Mr. Pendar, that valuable
time will be lost while waiting for news through
the sources you name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Possibly you are right, but I can think of no
other way that promises success. From Chesterton
you will first go to your home; you can reach
there to-morrow; you will tell your father everything
of course, and he will be as helpful as he was in
getting you a new aeroplane.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When he returns to New York he can telephone
the leading press-clipping bureaus and not
only set them on the watch for future bits of information,
but have them hunt for that which has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
been published lately. Something will be picked
up quite soon and then your real work will begin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What course do you advise me to follow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go to Albany or Troy, or even farther north,
making sure your father knows where to reach you
by telegraph. As soon as he receives the information
he wants, he can wire it to you and then you
will have to depend upon your own wits. I shall
venture upon a few more words of advice. Have
you had much experience in revolver shooting?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I have a fine Colt&#8217;s at home and my brother
Dick has one, and we sometimes try our skill at
targets, but he prefers a rifle or shotgun, and I
don&#8217;t particularly care for either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may not need any firearms, but don&#8217;t forget
to take your pistol and a fair supply of cartridges
with you. As they say out West, you don&#8217;t often
want a revolver, but when you do, you want it
blanked bad. It will be well also to supply yourself
pretty liberally with funds, for there&#8217;s no saying
what necessity you will run against.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall not forget your counsel; I appreciate it
and shall follow it in spirit and letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could go with you, but I am not my
own master. You have my address and will
inform me when you have any news to tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two shook hands and separated.</p>

A REMARKABLE LETTER.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SEATED on the broad veranda of his home
at Mootsport, in the soft summer moonlight,
with his father, mother, sister Mildred and
Mr. Hartley grouped around him, Harvey Hamilton
told the story of his aerial trip to Chesterton
in eastern Pennsylvania. All listened intently to
the account of the rescue of little Grace Hastings
from the Black Hand kidnappers, followed by
the strange disappearance of Bohunkus Johnson in
the company of the cranky Professor Morgan.</p>

<p>They had read of the former event in the newspapers,
but their interest naturally centered upon
Bunk, for whom each felt a warm regard. It is
not worth while to set down all that was said, the
conclusion of which was summed up by the merchant:</p>

<p>&#8220;The advice of your detective friend is good,
Harvey, and you must follow it to the letter. I
shall set the clipping bureaus to work as soon as I
reach the city to-morrow morning. You will go
by train to the Ten Eyck House in Albany and
wait there for a telegram from me. I feel sure you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
will not have to wait long. The curious fact in
this affair is that within the last two or three days
I read an item about a wonderful inventor who
traveled through the air without noise and could
remain stationary as long as he wished.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you remember the particulars?&#8221; eagerly
asked his son.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been trying to do so but am unable.
It was only one of the many references to flying
machines with which the papers are filled. Whatever
I might recall would be misleading, so it is
better to let it go. Some of those wide-awake
people will speedily unearth the facts, and I shall
lose no time in sending them to you. I can telephone
the agencies and have them begin at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus it came about that the next evening found
our young friend in the sitting-room of the Ten
Eyck, the fashionable hotel in the capital of the
State. The weather had turned chilly, with a
drizzling mist which made the warmth within
pleasant, even though it was the sultry season of
the year. It is tedious to await the deferred
coming of a friend or the happening of some expected
event. Harvey had gaped and yawned and
glanced through most of the metropolitan dailies in
the reading-room, weakly hoping to run across reference
to the subject that engrossed his mind, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
he found nothing and decided that he must depend
upon his father for the information needed.</p>

<p>He finished his evening meal, returned to the
sitting-room and a few minutes later received the
expected message. It was so full that it is better
to summarize what it said:</p>

<p>Professor Milo Morgan was referred to as the
coming Edison of aviation. He had perfected a
number of amazing inventions, such as a noiseless
monoplane that could be held motionless at will,
and was capable of a speed of nearly a hundred
miles an hour. The Professor was able to remain
above the earth for twelve hours. As soon as he
could triple this period he would start on an aerial
voyage from Quebec to Liverpool. He was not
quite ready to do so, but was certain that a few days
or possibly a week or two would see the marvelous
feat accomplished. He had sailed over several of
the States and gone as far south as the Carolinas.
His first intention was to cross the Rockies and
visit the Pacific coast, but he had decided to travel
in the opposite direction. The Professor&#8217;s workshop
was somewhere in Essex County, northern
New York, but he kept the exact location a profound
secret because he did not wish to be annoyed
by visitors and reporters.</p>

<p>&#8220;In Essex County are the Adirondacks, where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
brother Dick is camping out with his friends,&#8221;
reflected Harvey; &#8220;it is the close season, so they
daren&#8217;t disturb deer and other big game, but they
are having plenty of fun. Now if I could locate
the workshop of the Professor I should be able to
do something for Bunk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aye, there was the rub. As we know, the
Adirondacks cover a large area, so large indeed
that many a hunter has lost his way among the
solitudes and died of starvation and exposure. A
person might spend months in searching for
another, and unless he had some clue never gain a
glimpse of him. It would be the wildest folly for
Harvey Hamilton to try to trace the Professor
without more enlightenment than thus far he possessed.</p>

<p>The only information of value in the long telegram
was that the inventor made his home in the
large county, most of which lies to the westward
of Lake Champlain. It seemed reasonable to
believe that he was there at that time putting the
finishing touches to his machine, but so far as
finding him was concerned he might as well have
been in the heart of Canada or far out over the
boisterous Atlantic.</p>

<p>It will be recalled that Detective Pendar insisted
that many of the most brilliant successes in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
profession were due to accidental or trifling incidents.
Never did this truth receive a more
striking illustration than in the case of Harvey
Hamilton, within the same hour in which he read
the first telegram from his father. He had laid the
yellow sheets on the table in front of him and was
trying to figure out what he should do, when one of
the bellboys, in obedience to an order of the clerk
at the desk, handed him a second lengthy message,
which like the former was from his parent. It
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;A letter has just arrived from Bunk addressed
to you. It is without town or date, but the postmark
on the outside is &#8216;Dawson, N. Y,&#8217;, and it was
stamped yesterday. You can readily locate the
place as I haven&#8217;t the time to do so. I had to get
Mildred to help me translate Bunk&#8217;s spelling and
sentences, but we finally succeeded and here is the
result:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Dear Harv,&mdash;I hope you are well, because I
am. Have had a bully time, but the Professor
isn&#8217;t quite ready to start for Africa. He will do so
in a few days. He treats me well, but sometimes
he acts blamed queer. I guess that is because he
feels sort of scared about meeting so great a man
as my father, the Chief Foozleum. He told me
not to write to anybody at all because he didn&#8217;t wish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
any one to know where we are. He has gone off
for a little while and I take the chance to write
you, for I know you would like to hear from me
and I can get a chance to mail it when he isn&#8217;t
around. He must think I&#8217;m a chump not to
know how to write a letter without blabbing a
secret. I can keep things to myself as well as
anybody. If you&#8217;d give me a thousand dollars I
wouldn&#8217;t let you know that we have a cabin in the
woods near Dawson. No, sir; you can&#8217;t fool me;
I&#8217;m mum every time. My next letter will be from
Africa and written in the palace of Chief Foozleum.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;No more at present. Your loving friend,</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;&#8216;Bunk.&#8217;&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Yielding to his first impulse Harvey Hamilton
threw back his head and laughed till the tears came.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless your heart, Bunk! What should I do
without you? No more loyal heart ever beat
than yours. I can&#8217;t blame you for giving me the
slip as you did, and it is natural that you should be
filled with the scheme of an aerial voyage across
the Atlantic. If I can succeed in saving you from
the attempt, it will be through the help which in
the innocence of your heart you gave me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Manifestly the first thing to be done was to find
where the town of Dawson is situate. Harvey<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
had never heard of it, and in his perplexity he
applied to the clerk, who was not only courteous but
well informed. Pondering a moment, he replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;Dawson is a small town, though large enough
to support a newspaper, two churches and a public
school. It is in Warren County, well up to the
north and not far from Essex.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it is near the Adirondack region?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be said to be in it. Mount Gore, a
part of Schroon Lake, and several spurs of the
Adirondacks are in Warren, though you must
travel pretty well up into Essex to reach the heart
of the mountain district. Do you think of visiting
the section?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is my purpose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget that the open season for deer is
from September 16 to November 1, with the
chances that half a dozen amateurs will take you
for big game and plug you before you get a hundred
yards from camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no thought of hunting except for a
person who I have reason to believe is near the
town of Dawson. Can you tell me how I can best
reach the place?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go by rail to Beelsburg, where you will meet
a stage that makes the daily trip from and to
Dawson.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>&#8220;How long is the stage ride?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is called ten miles, but it is more. The road
is rough with a good many hills and bad places.
The journey takes nearly three hours each way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you inform me when I should leave
Albany to reach Dawson on the same day?&#8221;</p>

<p>The clerk had to consult the time tables before
answering this question. It took only a brief
while to fish out what he sought.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is eighty-four miles by rail with one change
of cars at Thurston, where you have to wait
twenty minutes. Leaving Albany at eight-thirty,
you reach Beelsburg in time for a midday dinner,
after which comes a jolt of a dozen miles to Dawson.
The doctors tell us that a vigorous shaking up is
good for digestion, so when you reach Dawson
you ought to be ready for another square meal.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harvey could not ask for more explicit directions,
and thanking the clerk for his kindness, he went
to his room. In the morning he sent a telegram
to his father&#8217;s office explaining his plans and
expressing hope of success. The programme as
outlined in the conversation between Harvey and
the hotel clerk was followed. Arriving at Beelsburg
on time, Harvey ate his noon meal at that
station, after which he and two passengers had a
tedious wait for the stage which ought to have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
arrived from Dawson an hour before the train.
When at last the lumbering vehicle swung round
the corner and drew up at the station platform, the
explanation of the delay was prosaic. An axle
had broken and the driver had patched it up until
he reached the wheelwright shop at the other end
of the village, where a longer time was needed to
mend the fracture.</p>

<p>Harvey&#8217;s fellow-passengers were middle-aged
men and neighbors who had much to say to each
other. What he overheard was of no interest to
him. Once or twice he was on the point of asking
questions about Professor Morgan, but they
showed no sociability toward him, and a feeling
of distrust held him mute upon the one subject
that filled his thoughts. He decided that it
was prudent to await his arrival in the country
town.</p>

<p>Harvey found the dozen-mile ride all that
was pictured by the hotel clerk of the Ten
Eyck House. For most of the way the gaunt
horses walked, except when going down-hill,
and in many places it was hard pulling for
them. But nothing of note happened, and as
it was growing dark, the stage halted in front
of the Washington House and Harvey, with
traveling bag in hand, sprang out. The others<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
remained in order to ride to their homes farther
down the street.</p>

<p>The hotel, with its rather high-sounding title, was
a small, modest structure, as was to be expected
where the guests were scant and far between.
The young aviator had no trouble in obtaining a
comfortable room. Had he been accompanied by
a dozen friends, they would have been accommodated
with the same promptness.</p>

<p>He had decided upon doing as he did in Albany,
that is, question the clerk of the hotel, who it
might be reasonably supposed would have a wide
acquaintance with the affairs of the neighborhood.
But a difficulty appeared at the outset: the primitive
hotel had no clerk. The landlord, a large,
beefy, slow-witted man, who wheezed when he
waddled about and seldom spoke unless spoken to,
and not always then, managed affairs, and sat at
the head of the table during meals. He showed
not the slightest interest in his solitary guest, but
filled and sent his plate to him by the hands of a
tidy young woman who evidently was his daughter.</p>

<p>Since, however, the Boniface seemed to be the
only available source of information, Harvey
wasted no time. The dining-room being empty of
all except the two, he finished his meal first, and
walking beside the table to its head, sat down in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
chair near the phthisical landlord, who glared at
him from under his shaggy brows as if he failed to
understand the meaning of the movement.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you please,&#8221; opened the guest, &#8220;I should
like to ask you a few questions.&#8221;</p>

<p>The host kept on eating, but grunted a response
which the young man accepted as permission to
proceed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.<br />


A WORKSHOP IN THE WOODS.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE brief conversation that followed was
unique.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am looking for Professor Morgan,&#8221; said
Harvey by way of setting the ball rolling. The
landlord thrust a big piece of meat in his mouth
and continued chewing, but a side glance showed
he had heard the words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know him?&#8221; continued Harvey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he the chap that&#8217;s got a shop about a half a
mile out in the woods, where he makes airships?&#8221;
asked the host in turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the man! What can you tell me about
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never heerd of him; can&#8217;t tell you nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then how do you know his workshop is half
a mile out in the woods?&#8221;</p>

<p>Harvey Hamilton had a quick temper and
resented the manner of the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t; I asked you if he&#8217;s the chap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What chap?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The one that has a shop a half mile away,
where he makes airships.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>&#8220;How do you know he does?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See here, young man,&#8221; said the landlord, so
nettled that he suspended mastication for the
moment and looked threateningly at his questioner;
&#8220;you&#8217;re getting too flip; I didn&#8217;t say that
long-legged galoot does nothing of the kind; I
asked <i>you</i> if he did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I answer that of all fools that pretend to
have a grain of sense you&#8217;re entitled to the medal.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with flushed face Harvey sprang from his
chair, stalked out of the room and banged the door
behind him. Perhaps he should not have been
so rude, but surely he had great provocation.
Undecided what he ought to do next, he went up-stairs
to his room. Dawson had not yet risen to
the dignity of gas, but he lighted the kerosene
lamp that stood on the little bureau, and sat down
in one of the two chairs with which his apartment
was furnished.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s provoking that I should hit upon the
biggest chump in this place to question, when
probably every one else could tell me what I want
to know&mdash;<i>Come in</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>The last was in response to a knock on the door,
which was pushed open the next moment, and the
young woman who had served in the dining-room
stepped within.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>&#8220;Good evening,&#8221; she said to the surprised
Harvey, who politely rose to his feet; &#8220;you know
I waited on the table.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember you; I am at your service.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was standing just outside the door that goes
to the kitchen and I heerd everything you said to
paw and what he said to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I got very little satisfaction from him,&#8221;
remarked Harvey, ashamed of his hasty words at
that time; &#8220;and am afraid I lost my temper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t mind paw, that&#8217;s a way he has.
He thinks it isn&#8217;t right to tell a stranger anything
about folks that have been guests at our hotel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harvey saw that here was the well of the information
he sought. He asked the young woman to
take the chair near the door, while he resumed his
own seat. She complied without any false pretense
of modesty. Being chambermaid, there was
nothing to criticise in her action.</p>

<p>&#8220;I gather from what you just said that Professor
Morgan has stayed at your hotel?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He never stopped over night, but he has eat a
good many meals in our house; he took dinner
here to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long has he made his headquarters in this
part of the country?&#8221;</p>

<p>She reflected a moment.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>&#8220;He come here last fall, that is, to stay. But
for weeks before that he had been sending all sorts
of stuff,&mdash;wheels, cranks, knives, engines, pieces of
machinery and lots of things the like of which I
have never saw, and they was carted out into the
woods, where he hired some carpenters to put up a
big cabin, and a still bigger one that ain&#8217;t very high
where he stowed his flying machine and other
things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he has made his home there ever since?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I &#8217;spose you might say so, though he&#8217;s away
a good deal; sometimes he&#8217;s gone for weeks afore
he shows up agin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long has he been able to fly with his
machine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say for certain, but the first time I seen
him was last spring&mdash;April, I think&mdash;when he
sailed over the town and we didn&#8217;t see him agin
for more&#8217;n a week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is his shop?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You walk down the main street to the second
turn, then foller a road that ain&#8217;t much traveled,
for about a quarter of a mile; then you turn to the
left over a hunter&#8217;s trail that has been there ever
since any one can remember, and keep along that
till you run aginst his cabin.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young woman, who announced that her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
name was Ann Harbor, illustrated her explanations
by so many gestures that her listener was sure
he could readily trace the eccentric inventor to his
retreat.</p>

<p>&#8220;You say he ate dinner at your hotel to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean him and the young colored man
with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ann&#8217;s big gray eyes became bigger with surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t have any colored person with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you have seen them together within the
last few days?&#8221;</p>

<p>The young woman gravely shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Professor Morgan is the strangest man I ever
have saw; he has been here a good many times but
never spoke a word to me, and I don&#8217;t believe he&#8217;s
said a half dozen words to paw; he never brought
any person to the hotel and I&#8217;ve never saw a
colored boy with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you ever been to his place in the woods?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; folks say he won&#8217;t let anyone come nigh it;
if a person does so he has some contraption that will
blow him into the sky; you don&#8217;t catch me running
such a resk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harvey Hamilton&#8217;s heart sank within him.
The fact that Professor Morgan had come alone<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
to this house for his meals had a sinister meaning
as regarded Bohunkus, whose appetite was something
which could be soothed only in the way
nature intended.</p>

<p>Had the lunatic discovered that Bunk sent a
letter to his friend, and had he punished him for
it? Was he starving the poor fellow to death, or
had he taken quicker means of ridding himself of
his company? Had he turned him adrift, dropped
him from his airship, or chosen one of a score of
methods for wiping the lad out of existence?</p>

<p>Such and similar were the questions that rushed
through the brain of Harvey as he held converse
with the young woman. While by no means
ready to give up hope, he felt that the outlook for
his friend could not well be much darker.</p>

<p>Since his caller had nothing further of importance
to impart, she bade him good-night and
thanked him for the liberal tip he gave her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say nothing to your father of what you
have told me,&#8221; he promised, as she rose to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can tell him all you wanter; I don&#8217;t care
what paw thinks about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no need of disclosing anything and I
don&#8217;t believe he wishes to talk with me after our
spat this evening in the dining-room.&#8221;</p>

<p>The night was unusually chilly for the season,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
but the sky showed signs of clearing. Harvey was
hopeful that the morrow would be pleasant,
although the country which he had entered lies
so far north and is so elevated that he found a
marked difference between its temperature and
that of his own home. It was on the edge of the
Adirondack region famous throughout the Union,
and so great an attraction that some of its annual
visitors come from across the ocean.</p>

<p>His plan was to go to the headquarters of Professor
Morgan, tell Bunk the real situation and
compel him to return to his home in New Jersey.
The actual problem he would have to face was the
inventor, who was likely to interpose and probably
forbid any action of the kind.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad I brought my revolver,&#8221; reflected the
youth, as he lay in bed waiting for slumber to close
his eyelids; &#8220;I pray that I shall never have to use
it, but it may prove the only means of saving Bunk
and perhaps myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he awoke in the morning he was delighted
to find that the day was an ideal one. The sun
was shining brightly, the sky was free of clouds
and the air mild, but with the crispness peculiar to
that remarkable section of our country. The
landlord did not appear at the breakfast table, but
remained in his office smoking a big briarwood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
pipe, from which fact Harvey decided that he had
already broken fast. His daughter Ann did the
honors, and the remembrance of the tip of the
night before made her do her best to please the
guest. When she had set down a plate of hot
griddlecakes and a cup of steaming coffee, she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Professor Morgan was here last night when
you and me was talking up-stairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he have the negro lad with him?&#8221; asked
the astonished Harvey.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was alone like he always is; he and paw
had a talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose your father told him I was here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know a word that either said; I asked
paw and he told me it was none of my business;
but I guess paw told him all you and him spoke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t see that any harm was done, for
the Professor would learn it when I called upon
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;La sakes! you ain&#8217;t going out to that awful
place, be you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I mean to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out you don&#8217;t git blowed sky high.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t forget your warning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you be back to dinner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not sure, but I hope to see you again
before I leave this part of the country.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>&#8220;If you go into the mountains look out for bears
and deers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harvey assured her that he would do his best to
follow her counsel. There could be no doubt that
his <i>douceur</i> had done good work.</p>

<p>His first impulse was to say a few pleasant words
to the landlord, as a sort of an apology for the little
misunderstanding of the night before, but the man
looked so sour that he feared another snubbing
and let him alone.</p>

<p>Directly after breakfast, therefore, the guest
stepped off the porch and started along the
principal street, but purposely took a direction
opposite to that named by Ann Harbor. Having
gone a few rods, he turned about and followed the
right course. He resorted to this little subterfuge
in order to learn whether the landlord felt any
curiosity as to his movements, and the trick worked.
The man had come out of his office, and still
smoking his briarwood, was watching him. He
knew of course that the youth was on his way to the
retreat of Professor Morgan.</p>

<p>&#8220;They discussed me last night. All of the landlord&#8217;s
sympathies are with the crank, so I can count
on no aid from him. It is well for a person to
know how he stands with his acquaintances.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ann&#8217;s directions were so clear that Harvey<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
could not err. He followed the street, took the
turn named, and finally struck the trail that led
straight to his destination. He was impressed by
the abrupt change in the character of the country.
A few steps seemed to have taken him from a
settled section to the primitive wilderness. The
ground rose steeply, rocks abounded, and the path
wound in and out among pines which stood like
sentinels guarding the approach to the forbidden
spot beyond. He pressed on, walking slowly, with
eyes and ears alert, listening and watching for
whatever might occur.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what the Professor and Bunk will
say when I walk in on them. I have been told that
the safest course with a lunatic is not to show any
fear of him. If you keep cool you can bluff it
through with the most violent&mdash;hello! here we are!&#8221;</p>

<p>He had passed around a mass of boulders which
towered twenty-odd feet above his head and had
come in sight of the structure for which he was
hunting. His first impression was regarding its
ordinary appearance, for it might be taken for the
home of some poor dweller in the woods. It was a
log cabin recalling that in which he had spent an
evening with Abisha Wharton in the Pennsylvania
solitudes, where he first met Professor Morgan.
There were the two windows with the door and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
small porch between, the half-story above, and the
stone chimney on the outside at the gable end.
The open space in front was smaller than that of
the other cabin, and not the first attempt had been
made at cultivation. The owner&#8217;s interest lay
wholly inside. Harvey noticed one significant
fact: the windows, instead of consisting of a number
of small panes, had each a big plate of glass for
the upper and a similar one for the lower sash.
This was probably with a view of improving the
light. From where the youth stood he caught a
glimpse of innumerable appliances, such as wheels,
rubber tires, coils of wire, tools and strange models,
which hung upon hooks or stood on shelves; the top
of a lathe showed, though his view was imperfect.</p>

<p>A broad low flat building to the right was the
hangar for the &#8220;Dragon of the Skies,&#8221; but he saw
the front was open and the remarkable monoplane
was not in sight; nor did he gain a glimpse of the
man or colored youth. While debating as to what
was best to do, he caught sight of a square of
white paper pinned on the door. Going forward
he read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">&#8220;WARNING!</p>

<p>&#8220;All trespassers are warned that any attempt
to enter this building without invitation from me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
will cause their instant death. The electrical
apparatus cannot be avoided and it strikes with
the suddenness of a bolt from heaven.</p>

<p>&#8220;The undersigned starts this morning for a
distant country and will not return for several
weeks. When he does so, the presence or absence
of dead bodies in front of this door will inform
him whether any one or more or none at all has
dared to disregard my notice. It will be equally
futile for any one to try to follow me.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV.<br />


THE BIPLANE IN ACTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">HARVEY HAMILTON read the strange
&#8220;Warning&#8221; twice through, by which time
every sentence and word were imbedded in
his memory. I am glad to say that in one respect
he showed common sense: he did not venture a
step farther upon forbidden ground. He was
tempted to try the door or windows or to explore
the premises, but the chances were a hundred to
one that Professor Morgan said no more than the
simple truth in the pencilled notice tacked upon
the oaken door of the cabin.</p>

<p>Possibly it was a violation of that law which
forbids a person to use a trap gun in guarding his
property against burglars, but if so, the fact itself
remained. The person who attempted to force
an entrance would undoubtedly run into some
infernal contrivance that would instantly blot him
out of existence. Consequently, instead of advancing,
the youth withdrew several paces where
he knew he was safe. He was still near enough
to read the ominous words had it been necessary,
but he could not forget them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>During the brief while in which he thought upon
their meaning, Harvey did a bit of reasoning that
would have been a credit to Detective Simmons
Pendar himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;That notice is meant for <i>me</i>. The Professor
learned last night that I was at the hotel and he
needed no one to tell him my business. The
closing sentence is intended to check any pursuit
by me. His statement that he has started for a
distant country to be gone several weeks is also
a bit of information for my exclusive benefit. He
doesn&#8217;t name Africa, but that is the destination in
his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t he take Bunk to the hotel for his
meals? Evidently he feared to trust him, suspecting
he would write to me, as the Professor may
have learned he had already done. Although Ann
did not tell me and likely did not know it, he has
brought the necessary food to this place. He
forbade Bunk to stray from the cabin, and the
fellow was so scared by the words and manner
of the Professor that he dared not disobey him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why is he so resolute that I shall not prevent
Bunk from going on a trip which only the brain of
a lunatic could originate? Bunk, in his first feeling
of resentment toward me, won the sympathy of
this strange person, who, as Detective Pendar said,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
saw how useful my friend would be as his assistant.
Had Bunk wished to leave him at the beginning
of their venture, the Professor might have consented,
but the poor lad is as eager as he for the
trip. The inventor is angered against me because
I am trying to interfere, and is resolute I shall not
succeed. His disordered brain has settled into an
iron resolve that I shall be defeated at every cost.
Until I can bring about some understanding with
Bunk and make an ally of him, I have the biggest
kind of a job on my hands, but with the help of
Heaven it shall be pushed through to the end.&#8221;</p>

<p>One phase of the situation gave Harvey a new
thrill of hope. Professor Morgan on his visit to
the hotel the night before must have learned that
the young aviator had come to Dawson by train
and stage, leaving his aeroplane behind. Naturally
he would conclude that his pursuer meant to
make no further use of the machine. Harvey&#8217;s
manifest course therefore was to turn to his aerocar
to solve the problem.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall go home as fast as steam can carry me
and return faster than it can bring me to this point
and it will then be do or die.&#8221;</p>

<p>The perplexing problem was to guess what course
the crazy inventor would follow from that morning
when he, with Bunk as his companion, had sailed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
into the northern skies. Was he really heading
for Quebec or some distant point that would
shorten the distance across the Atlantic, with the
purpose of striking out upon his crazy venture, or
was he subjecting his machine to a crucial test
before doing so?</p>

<p>Whatever might be the intention of Professor
Morgan, it was evident that he could not escape
that test, for previous to plunging into the aerial
ocean to the eastward, he must sail for hundreds of
miles over the New York wilderness and the solitudes
of Canada, so far from cities, towns and
settlements that if any accident befell the monoplane
it would mean the end of the aviator and
his companion. If perchance the long voyage
through the upper air was effected in safety, who
should insist the Professor was not warranted in
trying the far grander one that should land him
and his companion in Great Britain on their road
to Africa?</p>

<p>Hopeless as such an attempt must be (at least
until the science of aviation is much further
advanced than now), it was as promising as the
effort of Harvey Hamilton, to follow the flying
machine by rail, steamboat, stage, and on foot or
horseback. There were vast reaches over which
he would have to travel by roundabout routes and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
at a snail&#8217;s pace. Using every advantage at command,
he could not get to one of the Canadian
cities until at the end of several weeks.</p>

<p>We have no means of knowing what fancies
filled the brain of the man whose powers of reasoning
were warped, but who in some directions
was capable of as perfect logic as is ever displayed
by the most brilliant mathematician. The probable
conclusion reached by him was that his pursuer
would abandon the unsettled sections of the
country and take a direct course to the leading
Canadian seaport, with a view of heading him off
on the assumption that the monoplane would meet
with accident or delays on the way.</p>

<p>It seemed to Harvey that he had other ground&mdash;though
shadowy&mdash;for hope of tracing the elusive
Professor. He would not venture upon his ocean
voyage, as it may be called, until satisfied that his
preparations were complete. He had spoken only
a short time before of his conviction that they
would soon be finished. He was too skilled an
aviator to start for Europe before his machine was
ready. The chemical compound which he had
discovered would carry him the greater part of the
distance and it was reasonable to believe he needed
a few days in which to perfect its composition.
To effect this he would make excursions over the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
surrounding country, returning to his workshop
to push his investigations. It followed that if
this theory was correct, he would stay in the vicinity
of Dawson for an indefinite though probably a
brief time. If such proved the fact, Harvey had
fair prospect of success by shaping his own conduct
in accordance with such theory.</p>

<p>If I have made clear the conditions which our
young friend had to face, some deception on his
part will be justified. As has been said, the wording
of the &#8220;Warning&#8221; posted on the door of the
workshop proved that the inventor&#8217;s real aim was
to throw his pursuer off his track and end pursuit
by him. If the Professor could be made to believe
he had done this, he would use all the time necessary
to complete his preparations for his stupendous
aerial voyage.</p>

<p>These thoughts filled the brain of Harvey
on his return to the Washington House in
the little town of Dawson. Stepping upon
the porch and seeing nothing of the landlord,
he passed inside, where he came upon him
seated in his big armchair, slowly puffing his
briarwood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you let me know the amount of my bill?&#8221;
was the guest&#8217;s first greeting.</p>

<p>It was not necessary for the innkeeper to consult<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
his books, and without rising from his chair
he answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Supper, breakfast and lodging is two dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harvey handed him the exact amount, and the
landlord folded and tucked the bill into his waistcoat
pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Going back to New York?&#8221; he grunted, disposed
to relax now that he was about to lose a
guest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to New Jersey where I live. I
walked out to Professor Morgan&#8217;s place, only to
find a notice posted on the door to the effect that
he had gone away for several weeks. So what&#8217;s
the use of my loitering about here for all that
time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What the Professor says you can depend on.
If you come back in a fortnight, you mought git
sight of him, but there&#8217;s no sense in coming afore
that time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So it would seem. Have you seen anything
of him lately?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He hasn&#8217;t been here for several days and when
he does come he has powerful little to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harvey did not show that he knew this reply
was a falsehood. The inventor had been in the
house the night before and learned of the presence
of the young aviator without his machine. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
remained for the latter to make him think his
attempt at deception was successful. What surer
method could there be than the one Harvey was
following?</p>

<p>His next inquiry was as to the trains from the
railway station at Beelsburg, a dozen miles away.
The stage did not leave until early in the afternoon
and generally an hour&#8217;s wait was necessary
before a passenger could start southward. Harvey
proposed to hire a conveyance, which if it made
fair progress could intercept a train that passed at
noon. When the landlord named the charge for
the services of such a team, the guest accepted off-hand
and hurried to his room to bring down his
traveling bag. He encountered daughter Ann in
the hall, to whom he told his purpose. It was
safer not to enlighten her as to his real intention,
since nothing could be gained by doing so and she
would be likely to drop some remark to her &#8220;paw&#8221;
that would disclose Harvey&#8217;s scheme. So with a
friendly good-bye, he added to his former tip and
scurried down stairs, where he had to wait only a
few minutes when the open carriage drawn by a
gaunt, bony horse drew up and he climbed in. The
driver was a youth of about his own age, and a
sort of hostler and man of all work. Harvey never
met a more grouchy person. It was hard to make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
him say yes or no to a question, and the passenger
gave it up, after letting him know he was on his
way to his own home a good many miles distant.</p>

<p>None the less, the fellow knew his business and
landed his charge at the station half an hour ahead
of train time. Harvey slipped a silver half dollar
into his hand and he did not so much as speak or
nod, but circled around, struck his rangy animal
a whack with his splintered whip and faded from
sight in a cloud of dust.</p>

<p>Most of Harvey&#8217;s time on his way home was
spent in studying an elaborate map of the Adirondack
region, northern New York, and the lower
portion of the Dominion of Canada. His interest
in this work and his retentive memory caused him
to absorb knowledge rapidly and soon he began
to feel more familiar with the region than he had
believed possible without months of exploration.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I ever get through with this job I think I&#8217;ll
hire out as a guide for hunters in the Adirondacks.
I&#8217;m told some of them are paid big wages. It&#8217;s
odd that Dick should be somewhere up there and
it will be a good deal more odd if he and I should
meet. I forget what part of the country he dated
his letters from and it isn&#8217;t likely he stays long in
one place. Won&#8217;t he be astonished if I drop down
on him some fine day from the sky?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>It was on the following afternoon that Harvey
Hamilton appeared again at his home near the
village of Mootsport. A disappointment met
him. He expected as a matter of course that his
father would be in New York, but he learned that
his mother and sister had accompanied him thither
that morning. Harvey went to the house of Mr.
Hartley, but he too was absent for the day. The
caller explained everything to the wife of the farmer
and she promised to transfer the information
to the others that evening. To make sure on this
point Harvey wrote a letter to his parents in which
he told all that had occurred with him since his
previous departure. He laid this missive on his
fathers table in the library, said a few parting
words to the servants, and then hurried out to the
hangar to bring his aeroplane into service.</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect big things of you,&#8221; he said as he carefully
examined wires, ribs, engine, ailerons, propeller,
rudders and every part down to the minutest
detail. &#8220;It won&#8217;t do to have any defect, which
reminds me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He ran to the house again and furnished himself
with an outfit of the most modern fishing tackle.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no saying when I may need it. If
I should be lost in the Adirondack wilderness, I
might have to depend upon what I can take from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
the lakes and streams. It won&#8217;t do any harm too
to add to my stock of safety matches.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was little to make in the way of addition
to his former preparations. The same bag that
he had brought home was taken away swelled to
plumpness by indispensable articles, while his
extra coat was folded and tied to the seat, behind
him, where it could not be blown away by any gale
or flurry of wind. He did not think it worth
while to ask for help in making a start, for the long
sloping meadow was perfect for that purpose.
He followed his old plan of setting the propeller
revolving, when he dashed alongside the moving
machine, slipped into his seat, grasped the levers
and was off.</p>

<p>It seems incredible, even with the science of
aviation so well advanced, that starting from
northern New Jersey, the young aviator should
reach the Adirondack region before nightfall, but
such was the fact. His first stop was at Poughkeepsie
where he renewed his gasoline and oil,
stretched his legs, made another minute examination
of his machine and answered a few of the
hundreds of questions that were asked by the ever-increasing
swarm of people that gathered around
him. They were as friendly and good-natured as
they had been to Glenn Curtiss, who made his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
memorable flight from Albany to New York a
short time before. When Harvey soared aloft
once more, he carried with him the best wishes of
the cheering scores whose conduct was in pleasing
contrast to that of the young farmers in eastern
Pennsylvania who were bent on destroying the
aeroplane and became angered enough to try to
add the young aviator himself to the wreck and
ruin.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V.<br />

BY AERIAL EXPRESS.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">NO more glorious panorama ever enthralled
a human spectator than that upon which
the eyes of Harvey Hamilton feasted while
gliding northward on his way to the Adirondack
region. There were towns, cities, forests, streams,
and expanses of woodland in his own State of
New Jersey and the white-capped Atlantic rolling
to the eastward, with steamers and sailing craft
dotting its surface all the way to the horizon,
where the Atlantic&#8217;s convexity dipped and the eye
could penetrate no farther. The second greatest
city in the world spread out below him, with
smaller ones continually rising and sinking from
view as he coursed up the Hudson valley, sometimes
to the right, then to the left and again
straight over the picturesque stream whose crafts
of all kinds were hieing away from or to the metropolis.
Absorbed as was the young aviator in the
mission on which he had started he could not help
gazing below and drinking in the indescribable
beauty of the ever-changing picture.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much those who went before us lost!&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
he sighed; &#8220;and what delight awaits those that are
coming upon the stage of life! Aviation will
bring the greatest revolution mankind has ever
known. It is my happy fate to be one of the pioneers.
I wonder what remains before me and
others. At any rate none can feel more thankful
than I for the goodness of Heaven in permitting
me to see this day.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he progressed up the romantic valley after
leaving Troy, his thoughts came back to the serious
work before him. He had set out to save his colored
friend from a dreadful fate, and to that he
must bend all his energies until success or hopeless
failure came.</p>

<p>Basing his action upon the theory that Professor
Morgan had not yet started on his aerial voyage
across the Atlantic, his pursuer aimed to return to
the vicinity of his headquarters. It was important
that he should go as near to them as he could
without exposing himself to discovery. It would
never do for the crazy inventor to learn that the
youth&#8217;s withdrawal from the field was a trick.
The moment such discovery was made, that moment
the last vestige of hope would be snatched
from the would-be rescuer.</p>

<p>Harvey therefore made a circuit around Troy
and Albany, and when he turned in the direction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
of the little country town of Dawson, became more
alert than before. The local geography of the
section was so impressed upon his memory that
he recognized the leading points as he swept over
them. Besides directing his machine, he made
frequent use of his field glass. He scanned the
heavens in search of the Dragon of the Skies, that
he might flee from it in time. If the Professor
was abroad he would not be looking for the pursuer,
who counted upon detecting him first and
dodging out of his sight.</p>

<p>When he identified Dawson in the distance he
knew his supply of liquid fuel was pretty low.
He could renew it at that town, but it would have
been imprudent to do so, for his whole scheme
would be disclosed. In an effort to avoid attracting
the attention of the inhabitants, he veered to
the right, sailing as near the ground as was safe.
If Professor Morgan should learn that an aeroplane
had been observed in the sky, his suspicions
would be excited and he would see through the
trick that had been played upon him.</p>

<p>Eight or ten miles to the northeast, in the direction
of Schroon River, which empties into the lake
of the same name, Harvey saw the village of Purvis,
containing less than one-half the population of
Dawson. Gasoline is so common an article that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
he was sure he could buy all he wished in
that place and he shifted his course accordingly.
He was still flying so low that he was
not noticed until he descended in a large field
a little way to the eastward. He had hardly
come to rest, however, when he heard wild
shouts and saw not only men and boys, but
women and girls running toward him in a high
state of excitement. Harvey was uneasy until
he found that their curiosity did not decrease
their friendliness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Mister, can&#8217;t you give a feller a ride in
that gimcrack?&#8221;</p>

<p>The questioner was a barefooted gawky youth
with big projecting front teeth. He wore a ragged
straw hat, and his nankeen trousers were held up
by a single leathern suspender, skewered with a
nail in front. Harvey thought he might win the
good-will of the crowd by gratifying the applicant
and perhaps several others.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind if you&#8217;re not afraid to trust yourself
with me,&#8221; he replied, surveying the grinning,
freckle-faced countryman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gosh! what am I afeard of? If the blamed
thing can carry you round the kentry, why can&#8217;t
it tote me, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>And he laughed so hard that his shoulders<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
bobbed up and down and the wrinkles obscured
his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right; take your seat and hold on tight; you
must sit very quiet, for if you move the least bit
you may upset the machine and kill us both.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lad, nothing abashed, climbed to his place
with the help of Harvey and still grinning broadly
announced that he would not so much as bat an
eye while aloft.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let her whiz! I&#8217;m ready and I don&#8217;t keer&mdash;.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment a tall, muscular woman strode
from the crowd, caught hold of one of the ankles
of the boy above the bare foot, and jerked so hard
that seemingly elongated by the energetic pull, he
came bumping from his seat and struck the ground
so hard that it made him grunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll teach you how to play the fool, Josiah
Bilkins! The idee! You sailing up into the sky!
What are you thinkin&#8217; of yourself? Do you hear
me? Take <i>that</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time Josiah had struggled to his feet,
and with his hands over his ears to ward off the
cuffs that were rained upon them, and amid the
jeers of his acquaintances, he started on a run across
the open space. But his mother was fleeter than
he and kept up her castigation as they passed out
of sight around the corner of a house.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>None laughed harder than Harvey at the scene,
and when the turmoil had subsided he said to those
remaining:</p>

<p>&#8220;If any one would like to take a ride, I shall be
glad to give it to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>To his surprise, a middle-aged man, likewise
without coat or waistcoat, wearing a dilapidated
straw hat with his trousers tucked into the tops
of his cowhide boots came forward. When Harvey
looked into his tanned, grinning face, and noted
the yellow tuft of chin whiskers, and the fast-working
jaws, he recalled Uncle Tommy Waters,
the weather prophet of Chesterton. Encouraging
shouts were uttered by the man&#8217;s friends, but they
quickly ceased to allow him to talk with the visitor
to their town.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure the blamed thing won&#8217;t kick up its heels?&#8221;
asked the stoop-shouldered man, whom his neighbors
called &#8220;Gin&#8217;ral.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It never has done so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How fur have you kim?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From beyond the city of New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye ain&#8217;t lying, sonny?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; do as you please about trusting or believing
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m consarned if I don&#8217;t try it,&#8221; remarked the
General, stirred by the taunts of his neighbors.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
He climbed gingerly to his seat, aided by Harvey,
who was much entertained by his experience thus
far in Purvis. The passenger rigidly grasped a
support on each side, and chewing more vigorously
than before, nodded his head:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ready; let the blamed thing go!&#8221;</p>

<p>Cautioning him again not to shift his position
while aloft, but to keep perfectly motionless, Harvey
also seated himself, and asked one of the men
to give the propeller a whirl. The roar and racket
of the machine were deafening, but it began creeping
over the grass, rapidly increasing its pace,
until the moment came for the aviator to tilt the
front rudder upward. At the instant the bound
took place, the crowd, who were watching it all,
saw the General make a dive from his seat, sprawl
through the air like a frog and, lighting on his face,
roll over several times before coming to a stop.
The frightened Harvey made as quick a circle as
he could and returned to his starting point to find
the General standing among his friends, who
were chaffing him for his sudden loss of courage.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was the matter?&#8221; asked Harvey, though
he knew well enough that his passenger had
yielded to a sudden panic.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I happened to think jes&#8217; as we started
that I&#8217;d promised to meet Bill Smithers at his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
home and it wouldn&#8217;t do fur me to make him wait,
so I jumped.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was here all the time a-lookin&#8217; at you,&#8221;
replied the sarcastic Smithers.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; said the unabashed General,
&#8220;but I didn&#8217;t know it till I observed you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you want to see me fur, Gin&#8217;ral?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To git you to pay me that two dollars you
borrered t&#8217;other day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Smithers joined in the laugh at his expense and
Harvey inquired whether any one else wished to
take a ride with him. But the panic of the only
passenger at liberty to accept the invitation seemed
to have its effect upon the others, and no one went
forward.</p>

<p>Harvey now engaged one of the bystanders to
bring him a supply of oil and gasoline and filled
his tank. Then he bade his new friends good-bye
and sailed away.</p>

<p>His plan was to go as near as was safe to the
shop of Professor Morgan, then descend, leave his
aeroplane and make his further investigations on
foot. He could do this so guardedly that there was
little danger of detection. To attempt it with his
machine would bring certain discovery.</p>

<p>As before, he rose only high enough to clear the
large trees, many of which were taller than any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
of the buildings. The surrounding country was
wooded and mountainous. To the northward he
made out two peaks with a hazy ridge in the horizon
and knew that many miles of craggy wilderness
stretched beyond. He was all nerves while
drawing near the workshop, a half mile to the north
of Dawson, for necessity drove him forward fast
and the danger of detection increased with every
hundred yards he advanced.</p>

<p>Convinced that he had gone as far as was
prudent he sought out a suitable landing place,
fixing upon what had once been a cultivated field
of several acres, but was now lush grass, inclosed
on all sides by woods and matted undergrowth.
As nearly as he could tell he was within less than a
mile of the building from which all trespassers had
been warned under peril of death. He had no
time now to give to anything except the work of
landing and he did that with a skill that would
have won the praise of Professor Sperbeck, his
old instructor in the difficult science of aeronautics,
could he have seen it.</p>

<p>As soon as the wheels stopped running over
the ground, Harvey stepped out and pushed the
aeroplane to the side of the meadow and as near
the forest as possible. He even shoved it a little
way into the brush and under the limbs of the trees,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
taking care to injure none of its parts. The reason
for this precaution he explained to himself:</p>

<p>&#8220;Professor Morgan has the eye of a hawk, and
if I leave the machine in the open, he will catch
sight of it if he passes within a mile. He will
hardly see it, now that it is so well screened.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was risk of another nature in all this, but
he could think of no way to avoid it. If the
weather should turn bad, the apparatus was not
well protected. He would have given a good deal
for the verdict of Uncle Tommy Waters, but made
himself believe that no change of the character
feared was likely to occur.</p>

<p>If any persons had observed the descent, they
might make their way to the spot and wreck the
machine or disable it through their curiosity, but
he had to take the chances in that respect also,
and since there was no choice he did not hesitate.
He had located the shop of the Professor so clearly
while in the air that he was in no doubt as to the
course to take. He saw no signs of a path or trail,
and travel was as rough as that encountered on
his former visit.</p>

<p>Standing on the edge of the rocky forest, the
young aviator raised his field glasses and began a
study of the visible heavens, and within five
minutes of doing so he made a startling discovery.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>Far in the northern sky he descried an object that
looked like a stupendous eagle, soaring through the
air on its way southward. It was traveling fast
and steadily increased in size. Careful scrutiny
left no doubt that it was an aerocar, and a second
look revealed that it was a monoplane!</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the Professor!&#8221; exclaimed Harvey, keeping
the binoculars in place. &#8220;How fortunate that
I hid my machine when I did! He doesn&#8217;t dream
that I&#8217;m within hundreds of miles of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The course of the car was toward the spot where
the mysterious cabin stood in the woods. All
doubt that the air man was going thither was
removed. Harvey&#8217;s theory was verified. The
crazy inventor was not yet ready to start on his
momentous voyage and was experimenting before
doing so. Now that he had driven his pursuer
off the scent as he believed, he could complete
his investigations in his own shop where no one
dared disturb him.</p>

<p>As the monoplane coursed swiftly through the
air, a faint fear that it might not be the Dragon of
the Skies caused Harvey to listen intently. Had
the machine been of the ordinary kind he would
have heard its racket some minutes before, but
his straining senses caught no sound.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the Professor and no mistake; I can see<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
his erect body in his seat and almost recognize
those long, grizzled whiskers.&#8221;</p>

<p>But now when the monoplane had come still
nearer, Harvey Hamilton made the alarming discovery
that the crank inventor was alone in his
flying ship.</p>

<p><i>Where was Bohunkus Johnson?</i></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI.<br />


RECONNOITERING.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE all-important question still confronted
the young aviator: where was his colored
friend, Bohunkus Johnson?</p>

<p>There might be several answers to the query,
but none was satisfactory. Possibly he was at the
workshop of Professor Morgan, or had been set
down at the end of the experimental tours the
inventor was making, or the fate which Harvey
dreaded may have already overtaken him.</p>

<p>&#8220;The one thing for me to do is to have another
look at the Professor&#8217;s place at close range, when
he has no thought of my being near. I shall surely
be able to learn something worth while.&#8221;</p>

<p>Our friend kept the Dragon of the Skies under
scrutiny so long as it remained in his field of vision.
It was heading toward the cabin and in a brief
while dipped from sight. The inventor had
descended to resume work.</p>

<p>The day was drawing to a close. The sun had
set, and twilight was creeping over the dismal
wilderness. It was a hard walk through the
broken, rocky solitude where he could not find<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
any trail but simply knew the right course to follow.
He had brought a goodly package of sandwiches
with him and he now ate of the lunch. Fully a
dozen remained in the paper bag that was placed
on the seat before the tank, reserved to serve him on
the morrow. He was loath to leave the aeroplane
unwatched, but, as has been shown, there was no
help for it, and he now trusted to the good fortune
that had clung so markedly to him from the time
he first left home.</p>

<p>With a final inspection of the machine, he
skirted the edge of the wood to the farther corner
and then went toward the inventor&#8217;s headquarters.
It was hard work from the first. He was forced to
go around huge boulders and masses of rock, push
through the intricate undergrowth, now and then
checked and driven to make long detours, but he
kept the right course and knew he had only to
persevere to reach the spot in the end. The moon
did not rise until late, but the sky was clear, and
studded with brilliant stars, while the partial
lighting up of the obscurity enabled him to avoid
going astray.</p>

<p>As nearly as he could judge he had traversed
half the distance when, without thought of any
such thing, he came abruptly to the margin of a
large pond or lake. He could not recall having<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
noticed a sheet of water in studying his map of the
region and was in a dilemma. In the obscurity
the gleaming surface stretched beyond his vision
on the right and left, nor could he see anything
but darkness in front.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must cross in some way,&#8221; he reflected, &#8220;but
how shall I do it? I shouldn&#8217;t mind taking a
long swim, but it would be awkward in my clothes
and I shouldn&#8217;t like to call upon the Professor in
the costume of Adam and Eve.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had not left any of his garments with the
aeroplane, for there was no saying when he was
likely to need his outer coat. While the temperature
was mild, a certain crispness natural to the
season brooded in the air, and when he thrust his
hand into the water he found it thrillingly cold.
He inclined to the plan of fastening enough dry
limbs together to float his garments, while he swam
and pushed the little raft in front. He would not
have hesitated to do this despite the chilliness of the
water, could he have been certain that the swim
would not prove a long one. True, he was within
a half mile of the cabin, as he figured it, and it
would seem that slight risk was involved.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no saying how far I should have to
tramp to go round the lake,&#8221; he said, as he turned
the question over in his mind, &#8220;but the other shore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
can&#8217;t be very distant. The swim will do me good
and I&#8217;ll take it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He began groping along the shore in quest of
the material with which to make the float. It was
while he was doing this that he uttered an exclamation
of delight over another unexpected piece of
good fortune. He almost fell over the prow of
a canoe drawn lightly up the bank where its owner
had left it. The graceful craft was a dozen feet
long and the broad-bladed paddle lay in the bottom
ready for use whenever needed.</p>

<p>&#8220;If that isn&#8217;t rare luck then there was never
such a thing,&#8221; added Harvey after examining the
primitive boat, which, Indian fashion, was constructed
of birch bark sewed and gummed together
and thoroughly water-tight. He knew something
of canoes, shells and motor boats and had no misgiving
of his ability to handle this craft.</p>

<p>But what of the owner? Where was he and
when was he likely to return? Suppose he was a
hunter or woodman who would discover him before
he could get far from shore? What treatment
would he deal out to the one that was running off
with his property?</p>

<p>Hoping that the man might be near and could
be hired to set him on the other side, Harvey
called &#8220;Hello!&#8221; three or four times, in a voice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
that carried several hundred yards. There was no
reply however, a fact which convinced him that
even if the owner soon returned the one who was
making use of his property would be beyond rifle
range.</p>

<p>Night was advancing and Harvey did not linger.
He laid his outer coat in the farther end, and stepping
carefully into the unstable structure, picked
up the paddle, and pressing it against the bank,
pushed the canoe well out upon the placid bosom
of the lake. Taking his bearings, he glanced often
at the sky and with the aid of the constellation
Ursa Major (which always seemed to confront him
when he looked into the sky), he proceeded as
truly as if steering by compass. The paddle was
light, with a broad blade at one end. Facing the
way he was going, he dipped it first on the right
and then the left, so gently that he caused only a
faint ripple and made no noise.</p>

<p>He smiled at the discovery which came within
the following five minutes. The wooded shore
in front loomed to sight at the same time with the
terminus of the lake on his right. A detour of
two hundred yards would have led him around the
body of water, and a swim for the same distance
would have landed him on the shore opposite his
starting point.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>&#8220;I hope the owner won&#8217;t feel offended when he
finds his canoe has been shifted to another point,
for he won&#8217;t have to travel far to get it again.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few minutes later, Harvey drew the boat up
the bank and resumed his journey toward the
workshop of Professor Morgan. It will be remembered
that he was now quite near the little
town of Dawson, which he left to the right. He
held to his bearings so well that he came directly
upon the place where the trail turned off from the
highway and began picking his course to the cabin.</p>

<p>He was now &#8220;skating on thin ice.&#8221; The inventor
might be going to the Washington House
for his evening meal, or possibly returning therefrom.
In either case, the utmost caution was
necessary to avert a meeting with him. The
trail over which Harvey was advancing with the
utmost care may be described as an alley or avenue
or ca&ntilde;on, walled in for most of the way by rocks
and overhanging trees, with open places at intervals,
where the star-gleam showed objects indistinctly for
a hundred feet or less.</p>

<p>It will be noted that the youth had to guard the
front and rear, for there was no saying from which
direction danger would appear. He remembered
the character of the path, and stepped as softly as
a burglar stealing over a carpeted floor. When he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
had gone a few paces, he paused, listened, and
peered into the inclosing gloom. He had little
fear of meeting strangers, for the Professor had
impressed all with the peril they ran in yielding to
their curiosity. It was the fanatical inventor
whom he held in dread.</p>

<p>But his tense senses told nothing, and Harvey
finally turned the corner of the rocky avenue, where
there was a small open space, and the cabin loomed
before him. He stood staring, wondering and
speculating as to what it all could mean. The
building was utterly dark and silent. Its shadowy
outlines showed against the starlit sky, but it was
as if he were looking upon some huge tomb. The
gloom would not permit him to see whether the
Dragon of the Skies was resting in the hangar
provided for it, but he believed the strange air
craft was there, awaiting the whim of its owner.</p>

<p>While making his guarded survey, Harvey did
not forget the delicate situation in which he stood.
He was partially veiled in shadow and though he
heard not the slightest sound he turned his head
and looked back over the trail which he had followed
to the spot. A few rods distant it showed
a slight rise, so that he came down a moderate
slope to where he had halted. This low elevation
threw the summit of the incline against the starlit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
sky behind it and at the moment of looking, Harvey
saw Professor Morgan&#8217;s gaunt form in silhouette
striding over the rise and coming toward him, with
the well-known linen duster flapping about his
heels.</p>

<p>The watcher slipped a little farther to one side,
where he was effectively screened, and silently
awaited the man whose soft footfalls could now
be heard. A minute later he passed so near to
where the eavesdropper stood that a step toward
him would have enabled Harvey to touch him
with outstretched hand. But the last thing of
which the Professor was thinking was of intruders
into his domain. The tall form stalked across
the brief open space, halted an instant in front of
the door, at which the inventor fumbled a moment
and then passed inside.</p>

<p>Almost immediately the interior was flooded
with dazzling light, brighter and more vivid than
that of the noonday sun. Through the plate glass
window could be seen the endless paraphernalia
of the workshop of an inventive genius&mdash;the lathe,
bottles of chemicals, boxes, tools, coils of wire,
retorts, queer-shaped utensils, some suspended on
the wall, others resting on shelves, and many as
partially revealed lying on the solid planking of
the floor. The Professor himself took a few steps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
toward the rear of his shop and thus came into full
view. He did not doff his headgear nor remove
the linen duster which hung almost to his ankles.
Harvey saw him reach up to one of the hooks on
the wall, lift off a coil of copper wire, and then
bending over the lathe, set a small wheel revolving
rapidly by means of the treadle which one of his
feet pressed. No one could guess the nature of
what he was doing, except that it was a part of
his experimentation for the perfecting of the monoplane
which was already a wonder of its kind.</p>

<p>What Harvey Hamilton looked upon was of
absorbing interest, but he could not forget the
painful fact that Bohunkus Johnson was nowhere in
sight, and the painful question which he had asked
himself so many times still remained unanswered.
It was certain the colored youth was not here.</p>

<p>For a half hour the spectator stood as motionless
as a graven image, staring, listening, wondering
what was coming next. The inventor now
and then moved about the brilliantly lighted room,
but he was busy as a bee and as absorbed in his
work as if only a few minutes remained at his
command in which to complete the most important
task of his life. By and by he lighted a briarwood
pipe, and never once removed it from his mouth.
The clearness of Harvey&#8217;s view was proved by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
the sight of each little puff of smoke which at intervals
shot along the stem from his lips.</p>

<p>Being assured that Bunk was nowhere near the
place, Harvey saw nothing to be gained by acting
further as eavesdropper. He was withdrawing,
when, as suddenly as it had been lighted, the workshop
was shrouded in darkness. He waited
awhile thinking some slight accident had occurred,
but the impenetrable gloom continued. Professor
Morgan evidently was through his work for the
night, though it would be supposed that like most
monomaniacs he would have been unconscious
of the passage of time.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may mean he has solved the problem over
which he has studied so long,&#8221; thought Harvey,
softly groping his way back to the trail, along
which he threaded his course to the highroad and
then as nearly as he could judge to the point where
he entered it when coming from the small lake.
He was in a more confused state of mind than ever,
and could not decide what step he should next take.</p>

<p>He had settled upon one thing: while so near
Dawson he must so far as possible keep out of
sight of everybody. He dared not go to the hotel
for lodging and it was imprudent to apply at any
private house. His plan was to return to where
he had left the aeroplane, wrap himself in his outer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
coat and cuddle up in the seat for the remainder
of the night. The weather was so comparatively
mild that the exposure would not harm him nor
need he be uncomfortable. There is something
attractive to a robust, rugged youth in the idea of
camping out or roughing it, besides which he was
uneasy over leaving his machine without guard.
He was in a section quite well settled and the finding
of the canoe showed that people were liable to
pass that way at any time.</p>

<p>Having now no trail to follow, Harvey could not
accurately retrace his steps, but held to the course
so well that he reached the shore of the lake at the
time expected. But nothing was to be seen of
the canoe that had brought him over. He made a
brief but unsuccessful search.</p>

<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be far off,&#8221; was his conclusion; &#8220;the
owner will have no trouble in finding it, if he hasn&#8217;t
already done so and gone back to the other side.&#8221;</p>

<p>Recalling the slight expanse of water, Harvey
picked his way along the margin until he reached
the curving end, around which he passed, and then
resumed his direct course to the clearing on whose
edge he had left his machine. He saw and heard
nothing to disturb him during his return and
reached the spot while the night was still comparatively
young.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII.<br />


AN UNWELCOME VISITOR.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">YIELDING to a feeling of slight uneasiness,
Harvey Hamilton lighted several matches
and made an inspection of his aeroplane.
With vast relief he found it unharmed. If any one
had come upon the machine he had not molested it.
It was ready for service and he had a good supply
of gasoline and oil.</p>

<p>He had placed his bag of sandwiches on the rear
seat. Removing the food to the one he used when
sailing through the air, he adjusted himself in the
upper seat. Here with his coat wrapped about
him he said his prayers, and settled down for a
night&#8217;s slumber. He was tired and needed rest,
but his mind was so full of what he had learned,
and with speculations as to the immediate future,
that he remained awake far longer than was his
usual habit.</p>

<p>A strange theory took shape in his mind. It was
in effect that when Professor Morgan made his first
experimental flight he took Bohunkus with him
to some point where he had been left with orders to
stay until his master&mdash;as the man undoubtedly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
was&mdash;called for him. If he kept Bunk at the
&#8220;works,&#8221; the boy was quite sure to meet others
who might persuade him to run away. Hidden
somewhere in the wilds of the Adirondacks he
would not dare do this, but would meekly obey
instructions. He would be kept there until the
Professor had perfected his invention and returned,
when he would pick up the youth and start on their
trip to Africa. The question of food was simple:
Morgan could readily take what the fellow needed,
though not all he wished, to him.</p>

<p>On the supposition that our young friend was
right in his surmises, what could he do to save his
comrade? In what respect was the situation
improved or the problem simplified? A man can
disguise his personal appearance and often successfully
shadow another, so long as both keep
their feet on the solid earth. But nothing of that
nature was possible in the present instance. The
first sight which Professor Morgan should catch of
Harvey&#8217;s biplane would tell the whole story. He
would know the youth had returned to the lower
Adirondacks to take Bohunkus Johnson from him.
The discovery could not fail to throw him into a
flaming rage, and he would exert himself to destroy
the audacious pursuer. Harvey felicitated himself
upon his possession of the revolver and a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
supply of cartridges. While he did not hold the
crazy inventor in fear, he dreaded unspeakably a
hostile encounter with him, for the consequences
were sure to be tragical.</p>

<p>Finally the wearied youth drifted into dreamland,
slightly chilled but on the whole fairly comfortable.
He became cramped and as a consequence
awoke before the night had fully passed. He
shifted his posture and noticed that the risen
moon lighted the plain and showed the dark
line of the forest on the farther side. He had
reached the point of half consciousness, with his
nerves at the highest tension, when he was
startled by hearing a footfall among the shadows
at his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Somebody is prowling near,&#8221; was his thought
as he sat upright and listened. He heard again the
sound of rustling leaves, which showed he was not
mistaken.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello out there!&#8221; he called in a guarded undertone;
&#8220;who are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The noise ceased and there was no reply. Once
more the rustling was noticeable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you answer me? What do you
want?&mdash;Great heavens!&#8221;</p>

<p>Well might he utter the exclamation, for there
was an ominous growl and a big black body lumbered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
from the wood in the moonlight and swung
toward the aeroplane.</p>

<p>&#8220;A bear, as sure as I live!&#8221; gasped Harvey,
leaving his seat at a bound and taking care to land
opposite the intruder. The latter stopped, looked
at him and rearing on its hind legs, reached out
one of its huge paws and drew the bag of sandwiches
from its place. He must have scented the
meat between the slices of bread.</p>

<p>The food dropped to the ground and he clawed
the paper into strips, thrusting his snout among
the tidbits, which he began devouring with the gusto
of Bohunkus Johnson himself. No doubt he
found them delicious, but the drawback was that
the supply only whetted his appetite for more and
there was none to be had. Again he rose on his
hind feet and began exploring the framework of
the machine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Confound you!&#8221; shouted the alarmed Harvey;
&#8220;you&#8217;ll smash things all to pieces!&#8221;</p>

<p>It looked the next moment as if the bear meant
to climb into the seat and take charge of matters.
The grim humor of the situation struck the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if he has had lessons in aviation and
wants to show off his skill. Wouldn&#8217;t he cut a fine
figure in my place, yanking the levers and cruising
round in the sky? What would Professor Morgan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
think if he saw him? Probably he would suspect
it was I trying to disguise myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>But there was a serious side to the situation. The
machine was likely to be injured beyond the present
power of repair unless the brute were driven
away. After nosing for some minutes he seemed
to know that no more sandwiches remained.
That being the case, what more tempting morsel
could he ask than a plump American youngster
about seventeen years old? Probably from his
standpoint there was none, for at this juncture he
dropped back on all fours and started round
the aeroplane with a view of sampling that
youngster.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a good time for me to leave,&#8221; was the
hasty conclusion of Harvey, who plunged into the
woods, with the bear in hot pursuit. He knew
something of such animals, and although he could
see only dimly in the gloom under the trees, he
recognized a sapling by running against it and
nearly knocking himself senseless. He staggered
back, recovered himself, and grasping the small
trunk, ascended it faster than he had ever before
climbed a tree. He strove desperately, expecting
every second that the enormous claws of the bear
would grip one of his legs and drag him back to
the ground, but when he had gone so high that his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
support began bending over alarmingly, he knew
he was secure for the time.</p>

<p>A few moonbeams straggled through the limbs
and showed the dim outlines of the shaggy brute,
which once more rose on his rear legs and reached
upward, as if he expected his supper to drop into
his maws.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can wait there till doomsday, but you
won&#8217;t see me coming down to meet you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harvey was twelve or fifteen feet from the ground,
enough to ensure his safety so long as present
conditions continued. He had reached a limb
half as thick as the sapling and he swung a leg
over it. Thus he was able to sustain himself, but
the position soon began to be irksome. The limb
chafed his leg, and when he shifted it as much as he
could the relief lasted only a few minutes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, he kept his enemy under observation.
The <i>ursus</i> species is not noted for its intelligence,
but after awhile this one decided he was
baffled for the time. His kind cannot climb a
small tree, though they find little difficulty in going
up a shaggy trunk around which their claws do
not meet. This specimen sank back on all fours,
but held his place at the foot of the sapling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now what is he thinking about?&#8221; Harvey
asked himself, with a chill of fear the next minute,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
when his support was violently shaken; &#8220;I wonder
whether he&#8217;s going to pull up this young tree by the
roots. I don&#8217;t believe he can do it, but if he knew
enough he could wrap his paws around it and
draw it over to bring me within reach.&#8221;</p>

<p>The shaking ceased, as if the bear had given up
that idea, if indeed he had ever held it. The
obscurity was too deep for Harvey to make sure,
but he fancied that a tree, probably an oak, with
trunk several feet in diameter, grew so near the
sapling that it was within reach of his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Like enough he will climb it,&#8221; reflected Harvey,
&#8220;till he is higher than I am and then drop down
on my head. Why don&#8217;t he give up and clear
out?&#8221;</p>

<p>A little later it looked as if the brute had decided
to do the very thing a certain youth up a tree
wished him to do. He lumbered off a few paces,
taking him beyond sight in the dense shadows.
The rustling of the leaves grew fainter, and by and
by ceased altogether. Harvey&#8217;s hopes rose, when
fifteen minutes passed without the sound of a
growl or the stirring of the dead leaves on the
ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe he has gone,&#8221; whispered the lad, as
if afraid his voice might bring back his enemy.
&#8220;But it&#8217;s best to make sure.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>By and by the chafing by the limb which he
bestrode grew unbearable. He drew his leg over
and began sliding down the smooth trunk, inching
along, often pausing, listening, and peering into the
dusk, ready to scramble up again on the first sign
from his foe.</p>

<p>After a long time, he felt the toe of one shoe
softly touch the leaves. He lowered the other and
stood erect. The relief from his onerous posture
was great.</p>

<p>&#8220;It does a fellow good,&#8221; he mused, &#8220;I
wonder how those hunters stand it when they
are treed and kept off the ground for hours at a
time. I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m rid of this plaguy bear&mdash;Great
C&aelig;sar!&#8221;</p>

<p>A terrific threshing of the undergrowth showed
that the brute was returning like a cyclone. He
had gone only a few paces, as if to tempt the fugitive
to do the very thing he had done. I have said
that Harvey Hamilton when first chased by the
black bear climbed the sapling more quickly
than he had ever done a similar thing before. I
must add that this second exhibition in that line
surpassed his first, and established a record. In
a twinkling he was up on his perch again, with one
of his muscular legs doubled over the limb, feeling
as if he would stay there a week before running<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
so fearful a risk as the one from which he had just
escaped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of all creatures in the world,&#8221; he said disgustedly,
&#8220;the bear is the meanest. I never
harmed this one, and what has he got against me?
He stole my lunch and wants to use me as dessert.
It isn&#8217;t very pleasant up here,&#8221; he sighed, &#8220;but
it beats being chewed up by a bear. I wonder
whether there&#8217;s anybody near enough to hear me
if I yell.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was reluctant to resort to this, since the
coming of any person in the circumstances was
likely to interfere with his search for his missing
comrade. He decided to wait, hoping that after
all the bear would grow tired of hanging around
and swing off into the woods.</p>

<p>Harvey held on like a hero, shifting his position
so far as he was able, until it became so irksome
that he decided to slide down the trunk and run
for another tree. His dread was that in making
the attempt he would blunder and not find the
refuge at instant command; for with a ravenous
bear at one&#8217;s heels no person can afford to move
leisurely.</p>

<p>When it seemed that an hour had passed, though
the time was much less, he called out, pretended
to descend the sapling and really did go part way.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
The silence was so complete that hope sprang up
again, and by and by he glided slowly down inch
by inch until his feet once more touched the leaves.
He stood waiting and listening, but heard nothing
to send him scrambling back to his perch.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try it!&#8221; he said and began stealing toward
the edge of the wood where the aeroplane was half
hidden in the foliage and under the limbs of the
trees. He stepped as carefully as an Indian scout,
with hands outstretched, feeling his way and ready
to climb in a flash another trunk the instant it
became necessary. He knew he was advancing so
silently that if the brute was within two or three
yards he could not hear him.</p>

<p>Harvey took comfort in the thought that whatever
might happen, he was through with the refuge
that had tried him so sorely. There couldn&#8217;t be
another precisely like it and that of itself was
immeasurable relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should prefer a big tree even with the risk
of his following me&mdash;Confound it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then he caught his foot in a thick root
which lay parallel to his course and with the free
end projecting toward him. He raised his shoe
to step over it, but the obstruction rose also, and
despite a fierce effort to save himself he fell forward
on his hands and knees with a racket that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
could have been heard far away in the stillness.
Certain that his foe would be upon him the next
moment, he made a dash in the dim light, but
was brought up standing by an obtruding limb
which slipped under his chin and fairly lifted him
clear of the ground. For a single second, he fancied
his head had been shorn off his shoulders, and
he made a wild dash for another sapling. He
collided with a trunk and in his panic turned again,
and then suddenly halted.</p>

<p>Surely, if the bear was anywhere near, he would
rush for the spot, but he heard nothing. He now
changed his course so as to reach the open within
a few yards of his aeroplane. Most likely the
brute had grown tired of waiting and gone off.
The youth might have left his sapling some time
before and escaped all he had suffered.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII.<br />


THE PROFESSOR LEADS THE WAY.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">HARVEY HAMILTON was making his way
toward the aeroplane, when his right hand
touched a big lump at his hip. Reaching
down to learn what it was, he drew forth his six-shooter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be hanged! I&#8217;m the champion idiot
of the twentieth century!&#8221; he exclaimed, with a
pang of self-disgust as he looked at the small
weapon. &#8220;Every chamber is loaded, and I have
a lot of cartridges in my pocket, but I forgot all
about them until this minute! While I was
chafing my legs on that limb I might have
filled the bear with lead. His snout wasn&#8217;t a
dozen feet from me, and though I didn&#8217;t see
clearly I couldn&#8217;t have missed him if I had tried.&#8221;</p>

<p>He certainly had cause for exasperation. While
a Colt&#8217;s revolver isn&#8217;t a very formidable weapon,
and hunters as a rule do not seek big game with
small arms, yet the modern make possesses great
penetrative powers and it is quite likely that,
counting Harvey&#8217;s reserve ammunition, he might
have given the bear his quietus. Strange that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
our young friend never realized he was armed
until the necessity for it had passed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish he would show up again,&#8221; he added,
peering around in the gloom; &#8220;I should like to
square matters with him for what he made me go
through.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the brute was not seen or heard again, and
perhaps it was as well for the young aviator, who
might have been disappointed in the effectiveness
of his weapon.</p>

<p>A pleasing fact became manifest. Night was
ended and moonlight was giving place to the increasing
glow in the eastern sky that showed day
was breaking. The hours of trouble, annoyance,
vexation and danger were over and he must gather
up the threads of life again. He was hungry, but
no food was within immediate reach, and he could
afford to wait until the situation cleared before
seeking nourishment. He was within easy reach
of thriving settlements, towns, and even cities of
considerable size. To the north stretched the
picturesque Adirondacks, with their wealth of
streams, rivers and lakes, their vast areas of wilderness
and many recesses where only the solitary
hunter had as yet forced his way. Hundreds of
people in quest of health and recreation were
roaming through the wilds, living in log cabins or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
tents, or sleeping in blankets by wood fires, kindled
in the depth of the solitude. They spent the
glorious days in fishing, tramping and breathing
the life-giving ozone, which sent them back to their
duties invigorated, strengthened and renewed in
body and spirit. It was a famous clergyman who,
a half century before, published a book of his experiences
in the Adirondacks, insisting that the mountains
would cure men who had almost reached the
last stages of consumption. The tonic properties
of the region are extraordinary and the entrancing
story sent droves thither. The majority were
disappointed by his glowing pictures and when
they emerged and registered their names at the
primitive hotels on the outskirts, they added,
&#8220;Murray&#8217;s Fools.&#8221; None the less, unnumbered
invalids have found the section a veritable land of
hope.</p>

<p>There was no thought of anything of this nature
in the mind of Harvey Hamilton when he stood
beside his aeroplane, after an inspection had shown
him it was in perfect condition and ready for whatever
service he required of it. As is often the case
with the brain which is perplexed at night, it was
clarified in the morning. He was confronted by
a formidable task, but his policy was settled.</p>

<p>He fully believed that Professor Morgan after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
studying his invention in his workshop, subjected
it to the decisive test in the open air, by sailing
well to the northward and returning to his retreat
when he discovered any defect. The distance
passed might be ten, fifteen, twenty or a greater
number of miles. He had not yet perfected his
invention, but expected to do so quite soon. He
was resolute in his purpose to carry Bohunkus
Johnson across the ocean to Africa, and would
fight to prevent any one taking the negro from him.
With the whimsical persistence of an unbalanced
brain he grew to distrust Bunk himself. The
dusky youth had asked that he might be a passenger
on the wonderful journey, and having received
permission, would be held to the agreement.</p>

<p>It was this state of mind that led the inventor
to transport his assistant, as he may be considered,
to the northern terminus of those experimental
flights, and there leave him until the time should
come to start on the aerial voyage to the other side
of the world. As has been said, it was an easy
matter to take such food as he required, and Bohunkus
having no weapons and being in the heart
of an unknown wilderness, would be terrified by
the thought of trying to make his way out without
some one to guide him.</p>

<p>Such in brief was the theory that Harvey had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
formed and upon which he decided to work until
its error appeared. As he figured matters, the
great problem to solve was the location of the spot
where Bohunkus was held a virtual prisoner, for
the young aviator put from him the fear that the
crazy Professor had made way with Bunk.</p>

<p>If Harvey was right in his surmises, the monoplane
would soon wing its way northward, passing
not far from the spot where the other machine
was partially hidden on the edge of the small
meadow. Harvey must learn so far as he could
where the Professor&#8217;s destination lay. It would
be easy to do this, provided he could pursue without
danger of discovery, but that was impossible:
some other method must be followed.</p>

<p>Harvey decided to wait where he was until the
monoplane sailed past and then watch its course
through his field glass. If he failed to locate the
precise spot, he would approximate it and narrow
the area of search.</p>

<p>The aeroplane rested on the northern side of the
clearing, from which position it was impossible,
because of the intervening trees, to see the country
lying in that direction. It was so early in the morning
that Harvey felt safe in walking to the other
side, where his observation would be clear. Prudence
suggested that he should not expose himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
to the risk of detection, and it would have been
easy to skirt the open, thus keeping out of sight
for the whole distance, but the danger was seemingly
so slight, that he did not hesitate to move
out from the margin of the wood toward the opposite
limit of the unfenced meadow.</p>

<p>Straightway he received a lesson which he could
never forget and which came within a hair of upsetting
all his carefully laid plans. He was in
the middle of the space when there was a whirring
rush overhead as of the wings of a mighty bird,
and Professor Morgan in his monoplane shot past
directly above the youth, at a height of not more
than two hundred feet. Harvey stood still, dumfounded
and scared, for he was sure he was or
would be discovered in the next instant. Staring
upward, he saw the well-remembered machine and
read the ominous name painted on the under side
of the immense wings: &#8220;The Dragon of the Skies.&#8221;
The gaunt, long-limbed Professor sat upright,
staring ahead with his hands grasping the levers,
while he watched every movement of his car. So
absorbed was he in this task that he did not glance
downward at the form standing like a statue and
gazing up at him.</p>

<p>It was the narrowest escape conceivable for
Harvey Hamilton. He waited until the monoplane<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
in its arrowy flight was several hundred
yards away, and still going with the speed of the
wind. Even then if the Professor should look behind
him, he could not fail to see the spectator
on the ground. In a panic, the latter broke into a
run, not pausing until under the shadow of the
protecting limbs of the trees. There he waited,
glass in hand, and raised it to his eyes when the
gigantic bird was a long way off.</p>

<p>&#8220;He did not wait for breakfast,&#8221; was the conclusion
of Harvey; &#8220;which may mean that he intends
soon to return, or will eat his morning meal
somewhere else, or will go without it altogether.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sky was as clear and radiant as before, and
stepping into the open, the young aviator leveled
his binoculars at the inventor and his machine.
They seemed to be aiming for the mountainous
ridge ten or twelve miles away.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he stops on this side,&#8221; thought Harry, &#8220;it
will mean that Bunk is there awaiting him; if he
goes over the summit, it will signify that beyond it
is the place.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the twentieth time, the youth blessed the
makers of the admirable field glass which adds so
markedly to the power of the natural eye. The
whole expanse of romantic country, with its masses
of rocks, belts of forest, wild, uncultivated land,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
broad fields, small, winding streams, scattered
dwellings, three villages at varying distances,
rough surface of hill, valley and precipitous elevations,
some of which deserved the name of mountains,
was spread before him. The ridge, like a
mighty wall, shut in this impressive prospect on
the north. The side of the ridge was covered with
a growth of exuberant though somewhat stunted
trees, gray towering masses of rocks showing at
intervals; a couple of tumbling waterfalls, whose
bases looked like rumpled snow, could also be seen.</p>

<p>Harvey Hamilton, however, had no eye for any
of these: his interest lay in that object which was
coursing through space at tremendous speed, as if
it meant to dive into the forest which blocked its
course. He kept gently shifting the focal distance
of the glasses so as to hold the monoplane in distinct
view, though the edges of the wings showed
at times a fringe of prismatic hues that did not
interfere, however, with his vision.</p>

<p>Professor Morgan was flying low, but at the
base of the ridge, when Harvey expected to see him
make a landing, he used his elevating rudder and
skimmed upward toward the summit. The picture
was that of an enormous bird which with its
vast wings outspread was scaling the mountainside
by stepping lightly on the treetops and lofty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
rocks. Up, up, he climbed with dizzying swiftness,
was silhouetted for a moment against the
clear sky, and then shot out of the watcher&#8217;s field
of vision.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bohunkus is on the other side,&#8221; was Harvey&#8217;s
conclusion, as he screwed up the glasses and shut
them in their leathern case, which he slipped over
his shoulder.</p>

<p>It was guesswork as to when the Professor would
come back. He might make a brief circuit in the
sky beyond and return in a few minutes to his
workshop, or be out of sight for hours. It might
occur to him that it was wise to eat breakfast and
to get food for his dusky assistant. Be all this as
it may, Harvey decided to act at once, since nothing
was to be gained otherwise.</p>

<p>He ran across the open to his machine, pulled
it clear of the undergrowth and limbs, pointed it
toward the western limit of the clearing, spun the
propeller round, and sprang into his accustomed
seat in time to direct the fast rising speed. He had
a good supply of fuel and the biplane worked
smoothly. Swerving to the north, he &#8220;put on
steam&#8221; and was off.</p>

<p>His plan was to spin ahead until he reached the
base of the ridge, or perhaps passed a part of the
way up its side. He would be on the watch for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
a good landing place, hide the aeroplane as before,
and then press his investigations on foot.</p>

<p>Before he had gone half the distance, he abandoned
the plan of flying part way up the ridge.
A dread of the Professor&#8217;s return grew, and his
eyes began roaming over the surface in quest of a
safe place to descend. He regretted having come
thus far, and resolved to take the first chance that
offered. It appeared on a slight swell near the
base of the ridge, but somewhat to the right of the
course he was following. It was not the spot he
would have selected had he not been pressed for
time, but such as it was he had to accept it and he
believed it would answer.</p>

<p>He was not in a settled section, though one of
the villages could not have been more than two
miles to the eastward. The ground upon which
he rested his hopes could not have contained more
than a couple of acres and the upper end was shut
in by a lot of boulders which threatened to play
havoc with his machine. Both on the left and
right, however, were undergrowth and stunted
pines that promised to be a good hiding place for
the aeroplane. Accordingly, he dropped as low
as was safe, shut off his motor and dipped to the
rough ground. He landed with a bump that came
near unseating him, and would have shattered his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
front rudder against the boulders had he not
managed to veer his course so as to avoid them in
time.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t fancy this business,&#8221; he muttered, as
he stepped to the ground and looked the machine
over; &#8220;the folks at Garden City know how to
construct these things, for this one has stood a good
deal of jarring without harm so far as I can see.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a work of considerable difficulty to work
the biplane among the trees where it was not likely
to be seen by any one passing overhead, though in
plain sight of a person on the ground. Some five
or six hundred feet had to be climbed to reach the
summit. The surface was of the roughest character,
his way leading around piles of stone, through
thick woods, which fortunately were not cluttered
with undergrowth, across deep gullies, and so steep
in some places that it was trying even to a professional
guide or hunter.</p>

<p>Standing thus and debating the situation, Harvey
caught the murmur of the waterfall on his right.
He recalled that it was near, and would have paid
it a visit had not more important matters demanded
attention.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX.<br />


MEETING AN OLD FRIEND.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was a half hour&#8217;s climb to the top of the ridge,
it being so precipitous in places that even a
lusty youth like Harvey Hamilton had to pause
more than once to rest his limbs and regain his
wind. He accomplished his task in due time
and reaching the crest, uttered an exclamation of
amazement at the wonderful beauty of the landscape
spread before him.</p>

<p>He had crossed the boundary of the county and
was in Essex, which includes nearly all of the romantic
Adirondack region, familiar to the thousands
who visit it every year. As far as the vision could
travel were wooded mountain peaks, craggy spurs,
lakes, some of considerable size, the headwaters
of the Hudson and other rivers, waterfalls, dashing
streams, the country dotted here and there with
straggling hamlets, a fashionable hotel or two, scattered
cabins and rude dwellings, while tiny columns
of smoke climbing through the treetops told where
parties had their camps and were living in the open,
with the sensible resolve to get all that the forest,
redolent with spruce and balsam, could give them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>With the aid of his glass, Harvey identified a
canoe containing a man and woman, the latter
paddling up the winding stream far to the left,
while on the shore of the lake, to the right, gleamed
the white tent of some campers. He even recognized
the tiny figures moving about, and saw a
man enter a canoe and hurry out upon the sheet
of water, which gleamed like a vast mirror of silver.</p>

<p>The view was worth traveling thousands of
miles to enjoy. In all his wanderings through
Switzerland, the Tyrol, and Italy, Harvey had
beheld nothing like it. While those parts of the
Old World far surpass the Adirondacks in magnificence
and grandeur, there was a certain witching
charm in this place not easily describable that
enthralled the young American and held him
mute under a spell that no European scene had
been able to weave about him.</p>

<p>While in other circumstances he could have
stood or sat for hours drinking in the fascinating
beauty, he could not keep his thoughts from the
serious task upon which he had entered days before.
Bohunkus Johnson, if alive, was in peril from the
demented man who held him a prisoner, and his
rescue must be accomplished without waste of
time.</p>

<p>Somewhere in that unrivaled landscape, Professor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
Morgan had gone with his monoplane. Possibly
he had crossed the limit of the searcher&#8217;s
vision, but the latter did not think it likely. At
any rate he determined to examine the territory
at his feet before entering new fields.</p>

<p>The prosaic truth forced itself upon Harvey
Hamilton that his most pressing need just then
was food. He was sure he never felt quite so
hungry, and there was no call for him to suffer so
long as he was in a land of plenty, where hospitality
is the law.</p>

<p>His first intention was to go down the slope to
the lake, on whose bank the tent stood. He knew
he would be welcome and be given abundantly of
what he needed. But the spot was two miles off
at least, and somehow he disliked meeting a party
of jovial campers, as they were likely to be. He
was not in the mood for jest and quip and feared
that the contact would not help him in his self-appointed
task.</p>

<p>In the opposite direction from the lake, nestling
in a small clearing, was a cabin similar to those
which he had seen during his adventurous days
in eastern Pennsylvania. It was not more than
a third as far from where he stood as the camp.
While he observed no one moving about, a tiny
spiral of smoke climbing from the stone chimney<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
showed that the dwelling had occupants. He
decided to go thither.</p>

<p>This compelled him to leave his aeroplane behind.
Had the distance been greater he would
have used it, though still dreading a sudden return
of the crazy inventor and his machine. His own
brief flight to the spot did not seem to have attracted
attention and he gave the matter no further
thought, but set out at once.</p>

<p>As he drew near the humble structure he was
favorably impressed. It was made of logs, but
the two or three acres of surrounding ground were
under cultivation and the vegetables were not only
plentiful and vigorous, but there was an air of
neatness brooding over all, that proved the owner
and occupant to be thrifty and tasteful. The front
of the house was covered with climbing vines and
flowers, and the windowpanes were clean, as was
the little porch upon which he stepped.</p>

<p>That which he now saw pleased him still more,
for an old-fashioned latchstring hung outside in
accord with the primitive form of welcome. When
the leathern string thus shows it says: &#8220;Come in
without knocking.&#8221;</p>

<p>All the same, Harvey hardly felt warranted in
accepting the invitation. Instead, he knocked
sharply, and straightway bumped into another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
surprise. He heard quick footsteps, the lifting of
the latch from within, and then the door was drawn
back. He had raised his hat in salutation but
recoiled in pleased astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I declare!&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
expect to meet <i>you</i> here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor did I think I should ever see you again,&#8221;
was the reply, as the girl extended her hand, which
was grasped and shaken.</p>

<p>She was Ann Harbor, the daughter of the
keeper of the Washington Hotel in Purvis,
where Harvey had spent a night a short time
before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in,&#8221; said she hospitably; &#8220;Aunty will
be as glad as me to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harvey stepped across the threshold into the
living-room of the tidy dwelling. Seated at the
opposite window was a small, neat, motherly-looking
woman in spectacles engaged in sewing. She
looked up with a winsome smile and greeted the
visitor as his name was announced. She was
Hephzibah Akers, sister of the landlord of the
Washington Hotel, in Purvis, with whom her niece
Ann was a favorite. Hat in one hand, the young
aviator bowed and extended the other to the woman.
She motioned him to a chair and expressed
her pleasure in welcoming him to her humble<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
home. After a few commonplaces, Harvey turned
to Ann, who had also seated herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are quite a distance from Purvis?&#8221; he
said inquiringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so very far,&#8221; she replied lightly; &#8220;Aunty
doesn&#8217;t come to see us often, so I run up to see
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not as young as she is,&#8221; replied the elder,
&#8220;and she is kind enough to come to see me, though
not half as often as I should like to have her come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long have you been here?&#8221; asked Harvey.</p>

<p>&#8220;I left home yesterday morning; bus&#8217;ness is dull
with paw just now and he let me come up to
Aunty&#8217;s for a day or two. I shall have to go back
to-morrow or next day. Now, how is it <i>you</i> are
here when I thought you had gone to your home
in New Jersey?&#8221;</p>

<p>The visitor had considered this question before
it was asked. He decided that the best course
was to be frank with the woman. So in a few
words he told them that Professor Morgan had
taken the colored lad with him, and since the aviator
was known to be unbalanced in mind, Harvey
was doing his utmost to get his friend away before
it was too late. The story was so absorbing that
Aunty ceased her sewing while she and her niece
listened.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>&#8220;I did go to my home,&#8221; added Harvey, &#8220;but
came back as soon as I could.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you stay at our hotel last night?&#8221; asked
Ann.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, your father likes the Professor better than
he does me and I thought it best not to let any one
know I was in the neighborhood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you did right, for what you say is
true. The night of the day you went away, the
Professor stayed a good while at the hotel after
supper and he and paw had a long talk. I was
in and out of the room most of the time, so I
heard nearly all they said. Paw told him you
had gone off and we&#8217;d never see you agin; the
Professor said it was lucky for you that you&#8217;d
done so, for if you come round poking your nose
into other people&#8217;s bus&#8217;ness, you wouldn&#8217;t live to
try it a second time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mercy!&#8221; exclaimed the shocked Aunty; &#8220;why
did he say <i>that</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Cause he&#8217;s crazy,&#8221; was the prompt explanation
of her niece.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ann is right the Professor has formed a plan
which no one but a lunatic could think out; it is
that of crossing the Atlantic Ocean with his aeroplane
and of taking the colored boy with him.
If they ever try it, it will be the last of both. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
cannot rest idle if there is any way to prevent
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; assented Aunty; &#8220;it would
be wicked if you didn&#8217;t do your best to stop it.
Can Ann and I help you?&#8221; she asked with such
childlike simplicity that Harvey smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see no way unless you have some information
to give.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have seen the Professor and his airship,
I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Several times. I went to the spring on last
Sunday morning for a pail of water, when the thing
skimmed over my head so low that I ducked,
though there wasn&#8217;t any need.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which way was it traveling?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Straight north,&#8221; she replied, indicating the
direction by gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did the man give any attention to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t seem to see me, but was staring
ahead, with his hands on the levers each side
of him. He didn&#8217;t look down, but the person
with him did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said the interested Harvey; &#8220;he had a
companion then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; it must have been the young man you
spoke of, for I remember he had a black face; he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
leaned over, waved his hand at me and shouted
some words which I didn&#8217;t catch. He was sitting
beside the Professor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was Bohunkus. When he and I sailed
together, he never lost a chance of saluting every
one who looked up at him. Now, Aunty, you
tell me you saw an aerocar going northward; can
you tell me how far it went?&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I watched him till my eyes ached. I can&#8217;t see
very well with my glasses and he soon passed out
of sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what was his course?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not exactly north, but a little to the east of
north, toward Dix Peak and the Schroon River.
He may have kept on to Nipple Top and Elizabethtown
or even farther.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What time of the day was this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A little after breakfast. I was expecting Gideon
and had waited for him, but he must have
been too busy to come home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And may I know who Gideon is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why haven&#8217;t you heard of Gid Akers?&#8221; asked
the surprised niece; &#8220;he&#8217;s one of the greatest
guides in the Adirondacks. He is off now with a
party, near Sanford Lake and Mount McMartin.
He&#8217;s been hired till the end of August, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
manages to take a run down here once in
awhile.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know I never was in the Adirondacks till
the other day and really know nothing of them.
You tell me, Aunty, that it was on Sunday morning
that you saw the couple going northward in the
airship. Did you see them return?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was the funny part of it,&#8221; replied the
woman with a smile; &#8220;I was home alone all day,
busy about the house, for I don&#8217;t often get to
church, when I went out again to the spring. I
was dipping up water, when a queer shadow
whisked over me and made me look up. There
was the Professor, as you call him, going with the
speed of the wind to the south.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; he paid no more attention to me than
before, though he must have seen me, but the seat
beside him didn&#8217;t hold any one.&#8221;</p>

<p>This information was important, as confirming
a part of Harvey Hamilton&#8217;s theory: Professor
Morgan had carried Bohunkus Johnson to some
spot at an uncertain distance to the north, and left
him there, with orders to stay until his master was
ready to pick him up and start across the Atlantic.</p>

<p>&#8220;He went north again this morning,&#8221; said the
visitor, &#8220;and of course was alone.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>&#8220;Where were you when you saw him?&#8221; asked
the lady.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the other side of the ridge to the south,
where I had hidden my aeroplane.&#8221;</p>

<p>His listeners showed their astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you got one of them things too?&#8221; asked
Ann.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should have explained that I came all
the way from home this second time in such a
machine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you come here in it?&#8221; asked
Aunty; &#8220;I should dearly love to see one when it
isn&#8217;t whizzing like a bird through the air.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall have a ride in mine, if it can possibly
be arranged, and you too, Ann, for your kindness
to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The big gray eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>&#8220;That will be bully&mdash;I mean splendaceous.
Ain&#8217;t you afeard something will happen to it,
while you&#8217;re gone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think not; it is well screened from sight, unless
some one should happen to pass near. I was
afraid to use it to come any farther lest the Professor
should discover me. It is necessary that
I should prevent that at all costs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you stay last night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the woods with my aeroplane. You remember<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
the weather was mild, and I was comfortable
in my thick coat.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not think it worth while to tell them of
his experience with the bear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you have breakfast?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t have any, and only a bite or two last
night and, Ann, if you ever want to look upon a
starving fellow, just take a good look at me.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X.<br />


AUNTY HEP TAKES A RIDE.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THAT which followed these words was so
amusing that Harvey Hamilton laughed
outright. Aunty Hep dropped her sewing
from her lap and sprang to her feet, with hands
upraised in self-reproach.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mercy sakes alive! Poor boy! You are
starving!&#8221;</p>

<p>In the same moment, Ann Harbor without
speaking, darted into the small room at the rear
which served as a kitchen. Evidently she believed
in deeds more than in words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so bad as that, Aunty,&#8221; protested the
caller; &#8220;I am pretty hungry, but I can stand it
a little longer. I shall be glad to eat a belated
breakfast, but I beg you not to hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not to hurry,&#8221; she repeated reprovingly; &#8220;we
can&#8217;t hurry too much. You look pale and must
feel faint. It won&#8217;t take us long to get you something.&#8221;</p>

<p>He protested again, but was not displeased by the
promptness with which they met his need. Sooner
than he expected, a bountiful meal was ready, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
the coffee remaining in the pot was quickly
reheated and a brimming cup poured out for him.
They urged him to eat until he was compelled to
stop. He dared not offer payment and thanked
them over and over again. Their pleasure was as
great as his own.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m downright glad I didn&#8217;t have my regular
breakfast this morning,&#8221; he said, when he shoved
his chair back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked the hostess.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should have lost the best meal I ever ate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;La, now, you shouldn&#8217;t say that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother taught me to speak the truth at all
times; but Ann,&#8221; he added, turning to the girl
who was removing the dishes, &#8220;while you are helping
like the good girl you are, I shall go outside to
watch for the return of the Professor. It won&#8217;t do
to lose sight of him and he may come back at any
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>He walked across the floor and paused with his
hand on the latch.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;ll go to my aeroplane, and
when it is safe I shall bring it here for you and
Aunty to look at.&#8221;</p>

<p>With this understanding he set out on his return
to the spot where he had left his machine. He
was so grateful to the women that he was anxious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
to gratify them in every way possible, but he
could not forget his simple-hearted friend who was
in peril. More than an hour had passed since the
Professor had winged his way northward and he
was liable to return at any time or possibly he
might wait for a long while. Harvey had already
run great risk and could not be too careful.</p>

<p>He found that no one had been near the machine
and it was as ready as ever for service. It would
have been the height of imprudence for him to bring
it forth so long as the return of the Professor was
impending. He devoted a few minutes to oiling
the moving parts and giving the structure a minute
examination, and frequently he stepped into the
open space and studied the sky through his field
glass, searching for the object that had become
familiar to him.</p>

<p>Remembering what Aunty Hep had said, he
scrutinized the country a little to the east of north.
It was mountainous, wooded, unsettled, and so far
as he could judge contained very few or no cabins.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the place where I should think he would
hide Bunk, but his prison may be a score of miles
beyond the farthest reach of my vision.&#8221;</p>

<p>A mass of cumulous, fleecy clouds was drifting
across the sky low down, while the firmament
above was of a clear soft blue. Just below a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
stratum of snowy vapor, he saw what looked like
a bird with outstretched wings sailing toward him.
Its rapid increase in size and the power of the
binoculars quickly disclosed the fact that it was a
monoplane. Professor Morgan was returning to
his workshop near the town of Purvis.</p>

<p>Instead of taking the same course as before, the
inventor circled to the east, so that he was a fourth
of a mile distant on his nearest approach to where
Harvey Hamilton stood on the edge of the cleared
space with leveled glass. He was still flying low,
and in a few minutes sank from sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure that Detective Pendar would agree
with me as to the meaning of what I have seen
to-day. Professor Morgan carried food to Bunk,
and at the same time gave his machine a test so
far as he could. He has not yet accomplished all
he has in mind, though he may be close to it, and
has gone back to his workshop to continue his
experiments. He will stay there for the rest of
the day and make another trip to-morrow morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was drawing it fine, but our young friend
was so confident he was right that he acted upon the
theory. It will be seen that he was steadily
narrowing the circle of search. At daybreak he
had established the fact that the place where Bunk
was held a prisoner was north of the ridge which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
the pursuer crossed on his way to the home of
Aunty Hephzibah Akers. He had learned later
that it was somewhere in the wild region a little
to the east of north, which loomed up on the
farther limit of his vision. The next visit of the
Professor to Bunk ought to locate the spot so
nearly that Harvey could, so to speak, put his
finger on it.</p>

<p>Aunt Hep had resumed her sewing by the
window, and her niece having cleared off the
table was chatting with her about the remarkable
story told by their youthful caller, when both were
startled by a roar and racket which caused them
to listen with bated breath. Neither had ever
heard anything like it, for it will be remembered
that the monoplane to which they were accustomed
sailed on its aerial voyages without ripple
or noise. Ann sprang up and opened the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;O Aunty! here he is! come and look!&#8221;</p>

<p>As she called, she sprang off the little porch and
ran out to where Harvey Hamilton had just finished
volplaning to the earth only a few rods away from
the front of the house. Her relative was at her
heels, as much amazed as she. They stared at the
strange looking thing, and upon the owner&#8217;s
invitation went forward and listened, absorbed, to
his description of the functions of the different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
parts. Harvey patiently answered questions that
belonged more to a child than to an adult.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; he added, &#8220;I want you to take a
ride with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>They shrank back in dismay and shook their
heads.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t do it for worlds!&#8221; gasped Aunty,
and the awful thought caused her niece to whirl on
her heel and plunge through the door into the
house. A minute later she emerged again and
hesitatingly approached the others.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing could make me expose you to the least
danger,&#8221; said Harvey soothingly; &#8220;I have ridden
hundreds of miles in this and never been hurt; I
know better how to handle it than ever before; it is
in the best condition and you need not have the
slightest fear.&#8221;</p>

<p>The result of his persistent persuasion was that
the two consented to the venture which a half hour
before they would not have faced for a fortune.
He explained that they had only to sit still, after
he had adjusted their seats so as to balance right,
lightly grasp the rods at their side, and then fancy
that the long-reaching arms were their own wings
and they were two innocent birds coursing through
the upper regions. Just as everything was ready,
Ann was seized with sudden panic and would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
have leaped out, had not her relative caught her
arm and sternly ordered her to keep her seat.</p>

<p>When, in response to the whirl of the propeller
the machine began gliding down the slope, the girl
screamed and her aunt had again to check her.
Harvey sprang nimbly to his place and at the
proper moment pointed the front rudder upward,
and the aeroplane left the earth and soared into
the heavens. The load being greater than usual
he kept the propeller at its highest speed.</p>

<p>The young aviator proceeded on the principle of
trying to kill two birds with one stone. He could
give his friends the treat of their lives, but in doing
so, he steered toward the point where he had first
caught sight of the monoplane on its last return
from the north. He had become so used to
running the machine that he felt free to inspect
the country while gliding over it. Before starting
he had fixed the salient points in his mind,&mdash;the
lofty peak to the westward, the endless stretch of
wilderness, the villages and towns in the distance,
the few scattered cabins, the ridge to the rear, the
rushing, tumbling streams, and the lake a little
way ahead and to his right. Scattered here and
there were signs of life as shown by more than one
canoe, gliding over the smooth waters, or paddled
up the current or floating down it, with the fingers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
of vapor pointing skyward from the depths of the
forests where parties of tourists or campers were
gathered beneath. It was the glad summer time,
and the visitors to the Adirondack region were
numbered by the thousands. The open season
was not much more than a month off when the
hunters would shoot one another in the ardor of
their pursuit of big game, with an occasional deer
thrown in as a counterpoise to their mistakes.</p>

<p>With some misgiving as to how his passengers
would stand what was certainly an ordeal, Harvey
looked around at them. Each was tightly grasping
the support at her side, and they sat as rigid
as statues, their faces pale, but the glow of their
eyes showing how entranced they were with the
flight and how keen was their enjoyment of it.
When Ann&#8217;s eyes met those of her friend, she
shook her head and tried to smile, but did not
make much of a success of it. Exalted as were her
emotions when she gazed down at the wonderfully
picturesque landscape sweeping past, she longed to
feel it once more under her feet.</p>

<p>Harvey did not overdo matters. He flew ten
or twelve miles, which he was sure took him to the
point in his mind. He peered below but saw only
trees, masses of rocks and a small waterfall, but
no sign of life.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>&#8220;Now if Bunk is down there, as I believe he is,
he ought to notice this biplane. Likely he is
looking at me this very minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>Prompted by the fancy Harvey took off his cap
and swung it round his head, searching the earth
below in the hope of catching a response.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is so ready to do that sort of thing he ought
to reply. As I am carrying two passengers he
might not recognize me, but that need not prevent
his answering my salutation.&#8221;</p>

<p>The solitude remained as unbroken, however,
as at &#8220;creation&#8217;s morn,&#8221; and afraid to go any
farther, Harvey made a wide curve to the right and
began his return.</p>

<p>Although he had not caught a sign of Bohunkus
Johnson, he saw others. Two men standing on
the bank of the uppermost tributary of the Schroon
discharged their guns. They could have done no
harm had they been pointed at the aeroplane, for
the distance was too great, but the weapons were
aimed at nothing and the action was meant as a
salute to the navigator of the air. He saw the
gray puffs and waved his cap as the only thing he
could do by way of acknowledgment. A man
paddling up stream in a canoe held the blade
motionless and circled his hat, while his two
feminine companions waved their handkerchiefs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
and doubtless said something appropriate to the
occasion.</p>

<p>The large white tent to which allusion has been
made and which stood on the shore of the small
lake, was hardly a mile from the home of Aunt
Hephzibah Akers. The young aviator sailed
almost directly over it, leaning well to one side
and peering downward, but the camp appeared to
be deserted. He decided that the campers were
off on a tramp or fishing excursion.</p>

<p>From this point to the little patch of ground in
front of the home of Gideon Akers, the guide, was
so slight a distance that in a minute or so, Harvey
spiraled down as gracefully as an alighting bird,
on the spot where he had halted before. The
women sighed with relief and enjoyment as he
helped them to the ground. They were grateful
and urged him to spend the remainder of the day
at the house.</p>

<p>Harvey would have done so but for the feeling
that it would be neglecting the interests of Bunk.
Aunt Hep herself had commended his vigorous
earnestness, but the question which he asked himself
was whether to lay aside his aeroplane at
this point or to return to where he had wheeled
about when he came back. If he did the latter he
would advance that much nearer Bohunkus, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
his scrutiny of the ground had not disclosed a
suitable spot for landing. He feared he would
be caught at a disadvantage and find his machine
useless when he needed it the most. He decided
upon a compromise. He would leave the aeroplane
at the home of Aunt Hep, and since more
than half the day remained, press on afoot.</p>

<p>Accordingly he pushed the machine to the rear
of the dwelling, where a shed gave shelter to the
single cow whenever she was in want of it, and
managed to screen the biplane from sight provided
no one&#8217;s suspicion was drawn to the spot.
Then he bade his friends good-bye for the time and
started off on a tramp that was destined to bring
him an experience of which he little dreamed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI.<br />


THE CAMPERS.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS midday approached, the weather grew
warmer. Harvey Hamilton left his traveling
bag at the home of Aunt Hephzibah
Akers, since he did not intend to journey far, and
it would be easy to go back when necessary. Most
of the distance between him and the tent on the
edge of the lake was a gradual slope downward,
through the usual underbrush and around occasional
rocks and boulders, but the traveling, on
the whole, was not difficult, and he made fair
progress. He doffed his outer coat and slung it
over an arm as a sort of balance to the field glass
suspended by a cord from the opposite shoulder.</p>

<p>He remembered that when he peeped down
from his aeroplane he saw no signs of any one
near the tent, but if the owners had gone on a
tramp as he supposed, some of them had returned
during the brief interval. While drawing near
along the beach he saw a man a little to one side of
the primitive dwelling, where he had started a fire
and was evidently preparing the noonday meal.
His companion lifted the flap, stooped, and was in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
the act of passing from sight when Harvey caught
his first good view of the tent from the ground.
A little later the other person came out. This
brought him face to face with Harvey when about
a hundred paces separated them. The back of his
companion was toward the caller of whose coming
as yet he was not aware.</p>

<p>Harvey had noticed that they were attired in
modern camping costume, with leggings, gray
flannel shirts, and caps instead of hats. A gaudy
handkerchief was knotted loosely about the neck
and dangled over the shirt front, across which the
big red letters &#8220;C A &amp; W E S&#8221; could be traced,
as far as the young men themselves were distinguishable.</p>

<p>The one who confronted Harvey looked at him
for an instant, and then touched the forefinger of
his hand to his cap in military salute. The visitor
returned it and pushed on. The second camper
heard his footfall and wheeled around.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you do, sir?&#8221; he called. &#8220;We&#8217;re
glad to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>They both offered their hands as Harvey went
forward. He was won by their hospitality and
cheeriness of manner. He explained:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Harvey Hamilton, from Mootsport, New
Jersey, and I have come to the Adirondacks on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
a strange errand in which perhaps you can help
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will give us pleasure to do so,&#8221; replied the
one with the briarwood. As he made this answer
Harvey distinctly saw him wink at his companion,
who returned the trivial and yet often significant
signal. The young aviator was mystified, for he
suspected instinctively that something was back
of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are sophomores at Yale, and are up
here on a little outing. My name is Val Hunter,
and I am from Vicksburg, Mississippi. This ugly
looking tramp with me is Fred Wadsworth, from
the wilds of western New York. We have a third
member who sneaked off with our boat this
morning and there&#8217;s no saying when we shall see
him again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a brother who is a sophomore at Yale,&#8221;
said Harvey; &#8220;and he is or was a short time ago
somewhere in the Adirondacks. You must know
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is his front name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dick.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two looked at each other and Hunter said:
&#8220;I recall him and there isn&#8217;t a more popular
fellow in college. He can box, row, play baseball
and football, and leads his class in his studies.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>Harvey&#8217;s heart warmed to the Southerner.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you how glad I am to hear you say
that; something of the same nature has come to us
at home and father and mother are proud enough,
but Dick never tells us anything about himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We tried to get him to go with us on this trip,
but a party of seniors dragged him off. He was
very sorry to part with us and wouldn&#8217;t have done
so but for his promise made earlier. We are
honored in having his brother with us and beg he
will make more than a short call.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harvey was sure he had never met two finer
gentlemen. Val Hunter was a true specimen of the
aristocratic Southerner, with his black hair and
eyes, olive complexion, now darkened by tan, and
his lithe, sinewy limbs. His words were marked
by the slight drawl now and then and the suppressed
&#8220;r&#8221; which often mark the speech of those born
and reared south of Mason and Dixon&#8217;s Line.
His companion, Wadsworth, from New York,
was of stumpy build, with a round ruddy face, also
well tanned, light gray eyes and inveterate good-nature,
but by no means as comely in looks as
Hunter. It was evident that they were attached
to each other, probably on the principle of like and
unlike being drawn together.</p>

<p>In front of the tent and a little to one side, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
short decayed log had been rolled. This was
useful as well as convenient. When the young
men wished to smoke they could use it, if they
preferred to sit rather than loll on the bare ground.
Besides, if they needed a table for their plates when
eating, here it was, though an up-ended box served
them oftener.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was about to prepare dinner,&#8221; said Hunter,
&#8220;It being my day for such menial duty, but it is
early and we can sit for awhile. Have one?&#8221;</p>

<p>He handed a package of cigarettes to Harvey,
who thanked him and shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father and Dick do the smoking for our
family.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be along in time,&#8221; replied the other;
&#8220;cigarettes aren&#8217;t good for some folks and I&#8217;m one
of &#8217;em, which explains why I smoke &#8217;em. You
know that&#8217;s the basic principle of human nature;
the way to make a person do a thing is first to convince
him he shouldn&#8217;t do it. It shines out in
those beautiful lines of Shakespeare or Milton, I
forget which:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8216;I ne&#8217;er would have been in this condition</div>
<div class="verse">But for mother&#8217;s prohibition.&#8217;&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s clever in its way, because of the profound
truth involved,&#8221; remarked the New Yorker,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
&#8220;but for fine, delicate fancy it does not equal that
quatrain:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8216;This road is not passable,</div>
<div class="verse">It is hardly jackassable,</div>
<div class="verse">And you who do travel it</div>
<div class="verse">Should turn to and gravel it.&#8217;&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Harvey laughed at the solemn manner in which
this nonsense was delivered. Nodding toward
Wadsworth he asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;What do those letters mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>The other smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;That reminds me of a day when I saw a scorer
in the grandstand at the ball grounds ruling off
and writing captions on his card. With much
twisting of his mouth he scrawled the word &#8216;Ares.&#8217;
I asked him what it meant. With a look of pitying
scorn he answered: &#8216;Why them&#8217;s errors.&#8217; It is
with something of the same emotion that I reply
to your question: Those letters signify &#8216;Champions
of the Adirondacks and the Whole Empire State.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If your modesty strikes in,&#8221; said Harvey,
catching the spirit of the moment, &#8220;it will be
fatal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re afraid of, but wait till you
meet the Duke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And who is the Duke?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>&#8220;I beg pardon for not explaining before. His
full title is Duke de Sassy. He really is a poor
Cracker from Florida, who has such a hard time
getting through the University that several of us
are paying his expenses on the dead quiet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has he much ability?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the Southerner who took it upon himself
to reply:</p>

<p>&#8220;Below the average, which makes it all the
harder for him. Wadsworth and I, out of
pity, invited him to go with us on this outing.
Florida is a mighty poor place in the summer
season.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or any other season,&#8221; amended Wadsworth.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were glad to do so, but it galls us to fail to
see the first spark of gratitude or appreciation on
his part. Not once has he said so much as &#8216;Thank
you&#8217; for all the favors done him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is hardly fair to refer to his prodigious
appetite and I shall not do so further than to say
that it has doubled our expenses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you don&#8217;t begrudge him his food,&#8221; said
Hunter reprovingly to his friend, whose slur
struck him as in poor taste.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not; it&#8217;s <i>our</i> food that I dislike to see
appropriated by him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose the treat is so rare a one for him,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
suggested Harvey, &#8220;that he cannot help making
the most of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There may be something in that,&#8221; replied
Wadsworth, &#8220;but the fellow is absent and it doesn&#8217;t
seem fair to abuse him when he can&#8217;t reply, though
what we have just said has been said to his
face.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How does he take it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Grins and eats more than ever. Which reminds
me that the Adirondacks seem to have
become a favorite tramping ground for airships.
Two of them are hovering over and about us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; remarked Hunter, &#8220;and we saw a rarity
to-day. We were fishing when a biplane sailed
overhead with two women as passengers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you recognize the aviator?&#8221; asked
Harvey.</p>

<p>&#8220;How should we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; exclaimed the Southerner, and he and his
companion stared in astonishment at their caller;
&#8220;you don&#8217;t mean it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was certainly myself and the two ladies
belong to that house up yonder at the head of the
lake. I came to this section from New Jersey,
covering the whole distance in my aeroplane, and
I expect to return the same way, but with only one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
passenger. My machine awaits me at the house
of Guide Ackers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thereupon Harvey told his story, which it need
not be said was listened to with deep interest by
his new friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never heard of anything stranger,&#8221; commented
Hunter; &#8220;that crazy inventor whom you
call Professor Morgan has been in these parts for
nearly a week. We must help you to get the
colored boy away from him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be glad if you can, for from what I have
told you he is in imminent peril. You understand
that the first necessity is to locate the prison where
he holds the poor fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By George!&#8221; exclaimed Wadsworth, slapping
his knee; &#8220;don&#8217;t you remember, Val, that the
first time we saw the machine sailing overhead there
were two persons in it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right; we were sitting on this very log
with the Duke, all three smoking and talking of
nothing in particular, when the Duke caught sight
of the thing well over toward the other side of the
lake. He dived into the tent, brought out his
binoculars and we all took a squint at it. It was
going very fast and the man on the driving seat sat
up very straight with his hands on the wheel and
his feet down in front.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>&#8220;That was the Professor,&#8221; said Harvey.</p>

<p>&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t make out whether the one sitting
beside him was colored or not. He must have
fancied we were watching him, for he waved his
cap at us and we returned the salute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was Bunk: he always does that. Now,
how long did you watch the monoplane?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As long as it was in sight. It returned later
in the day and went back over the same course, but
it carried only one person.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That confirms the theory I formed some time
ago. Professor Morgan was afraid to have Bunk
with him at his workshop, because he might change
his mind and run away, or could be found more
readily by his friends. So he took him to some
place out yonder, where he intends he shall stay
until he is ready to start on the maddest trip an
aviator ever dreamed of. Now can you tell me
how far the Professor went with his machine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had the glass and was standing right here
watching him,&#8221; replied Wadsworth. &#8220;Up among
those rocks and trees which you see a little to the left
and six or eight miles away, the machine seemed
to come to a stop and to hang motionless in the air,
but that could not be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is exactly what you saw; the Professor
has invented what he calls an &#8216;uplifter,&#8217; which is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
nothing more than a horizontal propeller under
the engine, by which he can hold himself stationary
when he wishes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was so puzzled by the sight that I handed the
glass to the Duke, who laughed at what he called
my fancy. But when he had looked it was his
turn to be surprised, for he couldn&#8217;t see any aeroplane
at all. It had vanished as completely as if
it had dived into a hole in the ground. He passed
the glass back to me, but I was no more successful
than he. Then Val tried it with the same result.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You knew what that meant?&#8221; said Harvey
inquiringly. &#8220;There was no mystery about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I presume the aviator made a landing among
the trees.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His uplifter enables him to descend where he
chooses, for he can come as straight down as a
stone falling from the sky. A space a few yards
wide will answer and there must be plenty of
such spots even in so wild a region as that beyond
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That must be the explanation,&#8221; said Hunter,
&#8220;and of course he can make the same kind of
start, though we have never seen him do it. We
couldn&#8217;t afford to wait here until he came back,
but have noticed him several times since.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello! that must be the Duke!&#8221; said Wadsworth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
as the three heard the sound of whistling
from the wood on the other side of the tent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brace yourself to meet this undesirable citizen,&#8221;
added Hunter, lowering his voice; &#8220;try to bear
with him, for he needs your charity. He&#8217;s a
&#8216;bad egg.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The next moment the third member of the little
party, still whistling a popular air, came into view
from behind the tent and Wadsworth, who had
risen, said impressively:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Hamilton, permit me to introduce you to
the Duke de Sassy, a general nuisance and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII.<br />


BROTHER DICK.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE tall, handsome young man who came into
view and who had been referred to as &#8220;Duke
de Sassy&#8221; stopped short, his music nipped
in two, and for an instant stood speechless. It was
the same with Harvey Hamilton, who stared as
if unable to believe his eyes. Val Hunter and
Fred Wadsworth doubled over with laughter, and
dropped on the log behind them.</p>

<p>The latest arrival was the first to regain his
self-command. It was a gasp rather than an
exclamation:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be hanged!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dick, as sure as I&#8217;m alive!&#8221; responded Harvey,
rushing forward and grasping the hand of his elder
brother, who dropped the string of fish he was
carrying, and flinging an arm over the shoulders
of the younger, pressed him to his breast. There
could be no mistaking the affection of the two for
each other, and both Hunter and Wadsworth felt
ashamed of the harmless trick played their caller.
They abruptly stopped their merriment and the
Southerner swallowed a lump in his throat. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
had once been blessed with a younger brother, but
kissed him their long, last farewell two years before.
Wadsworth had never passed through the
sorrowful experience, but he saw the emotion of his
friend and respected it.</p>

<p>Dick and Harvey shook hands several times,
laughed, slapped each other on the back, and
asked and answered numerous questions before
they awoke to the fact that others were near.
Harvey had to tell about home and all the news
concerning the folks. Neither they nor Harvey
had thought of the brothers meeting, though it
would seem that the fact that Harvey&#8217;s destination
was the Adirondacks, where Dick was known to
be, ought to have suggested the possibility of such
a thing.</p>

<p>Grouped at the front of the tent the four youths
had a merry chat, for all were in high spirits.</p>

<p>&#8220;The minute I looked at Harvey,&#8221; said Hunter,
&#8220;I noticed his resemblance to Dick, but did not
suspect the relationship until he gave his name.
Then Fred and I knew before he furnished any
more particulars that you were brothers. Since
the Duke was absent, we felt it our duty to acquaint
Harvey with a few facts about his big brother,
though the task was anything but pleasant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seemed to give both of you a mighty lot of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
pleasure,&#8221; said Harvey, who was so glad to see
Dick that he reached over and shook hands with
him again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Possibly you are correct, though we tried to
keep down all signs of it, which reminds me that
the dinner hour is approaching and even now is at
hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>It being the turn of Hunter to serve in the culinary
department, he sprang to his feet, walked
over to where Dick Hamilton had dropped his
string of mountain bass and carried them to the
edge of the lake, where he began dressing and preparing
them for the fire, which was burning briskly
in the rough stone stove whose pattern, you will
recall, was described in the &#8220;Catamount Series.&#8221;</p>

<p>All three of the young men were the sons of well-to-do
parents and they went into the Adirondacks
fully equipped for their outing of a month or more.
The guide, Gideon Akers, had helped them in
transporting their tent luggage and provisions,
consisting of sugar, coffee, tea, prepared flour, condiments,
ham, condensed milk, etc., and the necessary
cooking utensils. After camp was made, the
professional guide left, to fill an engagement with
a larger party which penetrated much farther into
the wilderness. That all were provided with
firearms followed as a matter of course. Each<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
carried a Colt&#8217;s six-shooter, in addition to which
Dick Hamilton had a small Winchester rifle. He
needed no reminder that the game protectors in the
Adirondacks are keen in their work, and it would
have been very imprudent for him to shoot any
big game during the close season. He had no intention
of doing so, but he might need the larger
weapon in some emergency.</p>

<p>When he wrote home to his father that he was
on the trail of a gigantic buck, he told a partial
truth. He had met such an animal twice, and
knew its favorite haunt was in that region. The
temptation to run the risk of bagging him was
strong, and if all the circumstances were favorable,
he was not sure he would not take a shot at him,
though how to get the antlers home was a grave
problem likely to involve him in difficulty, with
the loss of the trophy and a tremendous fine to
pay. However, that was a question which may
be dismissed for the present.</p>

<p>As the three were seated on the log, Harvey told
again the story of Professor Morgan, the cranky
inventor, and the missing Bohunkus Johnson.
The negro lad was strongly liked by Dick as well
as his brother, and the sympathies of the elder were
roused. He insisted that no thought or attention
should be given to anything else until the colored<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
youth was rescued from what beyond question
was a situation of gravest danger.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I can lead you almost to the spot,&#8221; added
Dick. &#8220;As you know, I went off early this morning
in the canoe which I drew up in the little inlet behind
the tent where you didn&#8217;t see me. I paddled
to the farther end of the lake to fish in a splendid
spot and was there when that monoplane sailed by
and dropped down among the rocks and trees not
more than half a mile away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you notice where it landed?&#8221; asked Harvey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not precisely, for my position was so low that
it dropped out of sight before coming down, but
I can hit it pretty closely. What is your plan,
Harv?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us all start for the section as soon as we
have finished dinner, and then scatter and begin
our search. We can&#8217;t miss it.&#8221;</p>

<p>A difficulty presented itself. The canoe was not
buoyant enough to carry the four, though possibly
it might bear three. It was six miles at least to the
end of the lake and the tramp was a hard one
because of the roughness of the country, while the
water offered the easiest kind of a passage. Dick
struck the solution. Addressing Val Hunter and
Fred Wadsworth he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;There is not the slightest need of you going<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
with us. Harv and I will paddle to the northern
end. We shall then be quite near where there is
every reason to believe Bunk is a prisoner. When it
isn&#8217;t best to paddle any farther we shall pull the
canoe up into the bushes and hide it. Then Harv
and I will separate. We know how to signal to
Bunk, who will recognize the call and answer it.
If the Professor doesn&#8217;t come back and interfere
it will be as easy as rolling off a log.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That shuts us out altogether,&#8221; said Hunter,
&#8220;which we don&#8217;t like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not by a large majority,&#8221; added Wadsworth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall leave the glass with you, and when the
monoplane comes in sight you can study every
movement and quite likely pick up useful information.&#8221;</p>

<p>The proposal did not give the two much comfort,
but it was really the right thing to do. Provided
the brothers landed near Bunk, it ought to be
as easy for two to locate him as it would be for a
score of searchers. He had been an old friend of
Dick and Harvey from earliest childhood, and
they knew all his peculiarities. Held, as he no
doubt was, under the spell of the Professor&#8217;s
domineering brain, he might shrink from trusting
himself in the care of strangers. It was not unlikely,
as the brothers viewed it, that he would keep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
out of sight of Hunter and Wadsworth, having no
knowledge of why they sought him, or whether they
meant well, but it would be the other way when he
recognized his old friends.</p>

<p>This being explained to Val and Fred they
accepted it and the plan was agreed upon before
the midday meal was concluded. Dick led the
way to the tiny inlet at the rear of the tent, where
the pretty little canoe had been drawn up the bank.
He carried his rifle and a full supply of cartridges
with him and had also his revolver, as did Harvey.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose you have had occasion to use
it yet?&#8221; said the elder inquiringly, while they
paused for a minute or two to admire the graceful
craft in front of them.</p>

<p>Harvey shrunk from telling the story of his
meeting with the bear.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t fired it off since leaving home,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t likely you will have to do so,&#8221; remarked
the elder, with no suspicion of the whole
truth, &#8220;but it is well to be prepared. Step in.&#8221;</p>

<p>The canoe had been shoved into the water and
Harvey carefully seated himself in the bow,
though there was no difference in the fashion of the
ends, except in the arrangement of the seats. Dick
followed, first handing his gun to Harvey, who,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
having left his outer coat in camp, had nothing
more to look after. The elder had had more experience
in handling the ashen paddle, which he manipulated
in Indian fashion, dipping the broad
blade in the water on one side and drawing it back
with a powerful sweep and outward twist of the
wrists at the end of the stroke, which kept the
canoe on an even course. Harvey, seated in the
bow with his back to Dick, handled his paddle in
a similar fashion on the other side of the craft.</p>

<p>The task of propelling the boat was so light and
everything around so quiet that the two said much
to each other. They had a great deal in common
and talked of many things, of no interest to any
one else.</p>

<p>&#8220;You did mighty well, Harv,&#8221; said Dick,
softly swinging the paddle from which the water
silently dripped, &#8220;in tracking the Professor to
the Adirondacks. We get the papers now and
then in camp and read of the kidnapping case of
the Philadelphia merchant&#8217;s child, but with never
a thought that <i>you</i> were mixed up in it. After
plucking this dark-hued brand from the burning,
why not make it your profession? You can
skyhoot around the country in your airboat and
hunt out such jobs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll think it over, Dick, but I don&#8217;t see much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
profit in it. Detective Pendar offered to divide
the reward with me, but I couldn&#8217;t think of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not; Bunk hasn&#8217;t much wealth and
I don&#8217;t believe Mr. Hartley will give more than
twenty-five cents to get him back again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would hardly pay for the gasoline and
oil, to say nothing of my own keep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But think of the fun you would have. When
this business is finished I should like to try that
aeroplane.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be glad to give you and your friends all
the air excursions you would like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To get down to serious business, Harv, I see
only one thing that stands in the way of our success.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure you are right in believing the Professor
spends all his spare time in his workshop, and
visits Bunk only to carry him food and to see that
he stays where he put him. But he may complete
his plans sooner than we are figuring upon and
make his start for Africa before we can get our
hands on Bunk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be so, but I haven&#8217;t much fear of it.
He will have to take enough food to last them two
or three days and you know something of Bunk&#8217;s
appetite.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>It will be borne in mind that the canoe was
moving toward the northern end of the lake, in
which direction the two occupants faced. Before
them was the section in which they hoped to find
their missing friend. Their backs were turned
upon the workshop of Professor Morgan in the
neighborhood of the little town of Purvis. When
last seen he was traveling in that direction, and
the brothers ought not to have forgotten to watch
the sky to the south. None the less they did so
and the oversight proved unfortunate.</p>

<p>Harvey said something which Dick did not fully
catch. Without ceasing to swing his paddle, he
turned his head, glanced over his shoulder and
asked for a repetition of the words. Before the
younger could comply, Dick said in an excited
undertone:</p>

<p>&#8220;Cover your face with your handkerchief, Harv!&#8221;</p>

<p>The younger was quickwitted enough to obey
without stopping an instant to learn the reason for
the strange command. He snatched out the piece
of silk and held it to his nose in a natural manner
and awaited the explanation which he knew would
come in a second or two.</p>

<p>At the moment of looking back, Dick Hamilton
saw the monoplane coming with the speed of a
hurricane barely fifty feet aloft and directly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
over them. Professor Morgan had noticed the two
young men in the canoe and a tinge of suspicion
caused him to sail thus low that he might gain a
look at the faces of the occupants. Since the elder
brother was a stranger to him, it was better that his
countenance should be clearly seen, but one glimpse
of the face of Harvey would reveal everything.
If he bowed his head to hide his features the act
would be significant, but calling into play his
handkerchief had nothing singular about it. To
give naturalness to the action, Harvey emitted a
blast from his nasal organ which suggested the
honk of an automobile horn. In the uninterrupted
stillness the aviator probably heard it.</p>

<p>Dick gazed aloft and watched the swoop of the
machine with the strange man controlling the
levers, who leaned forward and over, and scrutinized
the couple so keenly that Dick caught the
gleam of the piercing black eyes, and circled his
dripping paddle about his shoulders by way of
salutation; but the Professor made no acknowledgment.
He continued to peer sharply downward
until he had shot well past, when he curved
upward and continued his swift course over the
sheet of water and the wooded country beyond. It
could not be seen that he glanced again behind him
but skimmed away with undiminished swiftness.</p>

DISCOVERY IMPENDS.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">HARVEY asked in a muffled voice: &#8220;May
I take away my handkerchief?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It can do no harm, but I don&#8217;t know
that your precaution did any good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I kept my eyes open and peeped over the top;
the way the Professor studied us proved he had
misgivings, but he did not see my features.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks as if he is not satisfied.&#8221;</p>

<p>The elder referred to the fact that the
aviator, instead of veering to the left and coming
to a stop as he had done earlier in the day,
continued his straightaway course. Harvey
unshipped his field glass and leveled it at the
object which rapidly grew smaller and finally
flickered from sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is doing that to mislead us,&#8221; said Harvey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there any way by which we can make him
believe he has succeeded?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How would it do to stop paddling and begin
fishing if he comes into sight again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am proud of a brother bright enough to think
of that; it is a good plan, for if he is not satisfied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
he will come back for another view and he mustn&#8217;t
catch us napping.&#8221;</p>

<p>Accordingly the paddle was swung again, and
the younger brother gave his attention to watching
the sky in every direction, for it was possible that
with so swift a machine as was at his command
the Professor might make a wide circuit and swoop
down upon them again from the rear.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he does,&#8221; said Harvey, &#8220;it will show that
he doesn&#8217;t like the look of things, and if I resort to
my handkerchief again he will know why I do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which will be as bad as if you didn&#8217;t do it.
If we can reach the end of the lake before he returns
we&#8217;ll begin our hunt without more delay,
but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By George! Yonder he comes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick! Get out your fishing line; I always
carry mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dick dropped the paddle in the bottom of the
canoe and in a twinkling had flung the sinker into
the crystalline water. It took Harvey a little
longer, but he did it, with a number of seconds to
spare. They could well affect not to be aware of
the aerocar, though it was sailing low down, since
it moved silently, and true fishermen are always
absorbed in the work, or rather pleasure, of trying
to woo a bite from the finny inhabitants below<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
the surface. Neither seemed to look up, but none
the less they kept a stealthy watch for the monoplane
in which they were interested.</p>

<p>Professor Morgan gave a thrilling exhibition of
his machine&#8217;s capability and his skill in handling
it. He made a sweeping curve which took him
past the fishermen, swooping gracefully to the
right and to the left at a height of less than a
hundred feet. When he was nearest them he
shouted:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, there! What are you doing?&#8221;</p>

<p>Harvey Hamilton just then was excitedly pulling
at his line as if he had a bite and was more anxious
to land his catch than to do anything else. Dick
suspended his occupation and looked up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you see we are fishing?&#8221; was his fitting
reply in the form of a question.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are watching <i>me</i>,&#8221; insisted the aviator, as
he made another circle and came nearer.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do we care about you? You are scaring
away the fish; I wish you would clear out and
leave us alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is that with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bill Jones, from Squedunk; he hasn&#8217;t much
sense and if you don&#8217;t look out he&#8217;ll take a shot
at you with his revolver, and if he doesn&#8217;t <i>I will</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>And Dick dropped his fishing line over the edge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
of the canoe, picked up his rifle and pointed it at
the loony inventor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get!&#8221; he commanded, &#8220;before I fire!&#8221;</p>

<p>The demonstration was unexpected, and scared
Professor Morgan. Had it not been done at the
psychological moment, it is likely he would have
approached still closer and forced Harvey to disclose
himself. The youth was in a tremor, but
it was hard for him to restrain his merriment over
the rank bluffing of his brother. The Professor
yanked his levers and with his feet abruptly turned
the rudder so that his machine shot off at a tangent
at an amazing rate of speed. Instead of turning
back over his course, he made for the wooded,
rocky, mountainous country which had been his
destination when he believed he was not under the
eye of any one. As soon as he was beyond distinct
vision, Harvey dropped his fishing line and
brought his field glass into use.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep an eye on him as long as he&#8217;s in sight,&#8221;
warned Dick, who also laid his line aside and
turned to watch the aviator. The latter held to a
direct course for half a mile or more, by which time
he was above the section where the brothers believed
Bohunkus Johnson was kept in confinement.</p>

<p>&#8220;He seems to have stopped,&#8221; said Dick.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has; he is descending.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>Holding his machine in poise for a minute or
two, Harvey saw it dropping down like a weight
suspended at the end of a rope. It disappeared
behind a mass of rocks and amid a group of large
trees covered with exuberant foliage.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks as if that is the spot for which we are
hunting,&#8221; said Harvey lowering the glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;All the same it isn&#8217;t; it&#8217;s a trick meant to make
us believe it is. Professor Morgan may be crazy
regarding aeroplanes, but he isn&#8217;t in a good many
other things. It has become a game of hide and
seek between us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Conceding this to be the truth, our young
friends had to decide upon their next step.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we land and go to the place, he will know we
are more interested in him than he thinks we ought
to be. He is watching us from where he landed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if we go there we shall not find Bunk.
I do not think he is anywhere near. Meanwhile,
the best thing we can do is to keep on fishing.
Doubtless he has a glass and is scrutinizing us
like a cat watching a mouse. Let&#8217;s drop our lines
into the water.&#8221;</p>

<p>They did so and a minute later Harvey felt a
tug at his hook. Drawing in his line, he landed a
plump bass that must have weighed nearly two
pounds.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>&#8220;If the Professor has noticed that,&#8221; remarked
the younger, &#8220;it will help him to believe we are no
more than we pretend to be; but, Dick, I don&#8217;t
understand why he doesn&#8217;t shut us off from interfering
with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How would he do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pick up Bunk and carry him away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He could keep him in his workshop for the
little while that must pass before he starts on his
grand flight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Professor is shrewd enough to know
the risk he will run. He took him away
from that place because he was afraid Bunk
would give him the slip. It would require too
much of the Professor&#8217;s time to watch Bunk
and hold him under his thumb. Besides, what
is to prevent our hurrying to Dawson or some
other nearby town and securing a writ of
<i>habeas corpus</i> from a judge which would require
the Professor to produce the body of Bunk in
court and explain why he is held in durance,&mdash;I
believe that&#8217;s the way they put it. Such a proceeding
would not only be highly unpleasant
to the Professor but would be followed by more
unpleasant ones,&mdash;such as a lunacy commission
to look into his own affairs. The aerial trip<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
across the Atlantic would be knocked higher
than Gilderoy&#8217;s kite.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If he is afraid to keep Bunk in his workshop,
he can take him to any one of a score of places
where he would be as well hidden as now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is what I&#8217;m afraid of. It seems to me
we played our parts so well that very little suspicion
is left in the Professor&#8217;s mind. Were it
otherwise he would shift Bunk&#8217;s temporary home,
though it isn&#8217;t likely he can hit at once upon one
that is as satisfactory.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then for the present we must continue to be
fishermen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So it strikes me, and if he is observing us
closely he will admit that we are giving a very good
imitation of fishermen,&#8221; added Dick as he drew
in a bass almost as large as his brother&#8217;s. &#8220;You
are facing the spot where you last saw him; give
that as much attention as you do your line.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus the situation remained for more than half
an hour, during which two more fish were landed.
It irked the brothers thus to sit idle, with the soft
summer afternoon slipping past and the minutes
going by unimproved. When they left camp it
was with high hopes of bringing Bunk back before
nightfall, but the prospect looked doubtful.</p>

<p>Suddenly Harvey saw a peculiar flickering agitation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
behind the rocks where the monoplane had
disappeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something&#8217;s up!&#8221; he whispered, letting his line
fall and bringing his glass again into play. &#8220;The
Professor is bestirring himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>First the widespread wings of the monoplane
rose slowly into sight; the powerful engine, slender
body and rudders at the rear following. The
uplifter was doing duty and the Dragon of the Skies
climbed the aerial stairway smoothly and silently.</p>

<p>&#8220;See whether he has Bunk with him,&#8221; cautioned
Dick, looking keenly in the same direction; &#8220;that&#8217;s
the important point.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By George! <i>he has!</i>&#8221; exclaimed Harvey; &#8220;I
see him plainly!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me have a look!&#8221;</p>

<p>Harvey passed the instrument to his brother,
who hastily leveled it at the machine. &#8220;You
can&#8217;t miss him,&#8221; added the younger; &#8220;he is sitting
in his old place on the seat beside the Professor,
who is so tall that his head rises far over
Bunk&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dick was silent for a brief while. Suddenly he
lowered the glass with a laughing exclamation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, but the Professor is sly. I see the form
behind him as you have described, but it isn&#8217;t
Bohunkus Johnson!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; asked the amazed
Harvey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Study it out for yourself,&#8221; replied the other,
handing over the instrument.</p>

<p>A few seconds&#8217; scrutiny was enough. That
which Harvey had taken for their colored friend
was a cunningly arranged dummy which might
well deceive a spectator. Professor Morgan had
adjusted a coat and other garments so as to
resemble the form of the negro and make the mistake
almost certain. But for the keener shrewdness
of his brother, Harvey would have been
deceived.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see what you mean, Dick; I hadn&#8217;t the first
suspicion of such a trick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are not dealing with a fool when we butt
against the Professor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He keeps going toward Purvis,&#8221; said Dick,
who had once more resorted to his field glass; &#8220;he
seems to be certain he has misled us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t he be? His last view showed
him we were fishing as hard as ever and he
must believe we shall not figure any more in his
affairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Dick, we must be up and doing if we
expect to help Bunk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True; we are through fishing for the present.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>They flung the lines down in the boat, Dick
took up the paddle.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we have to camp out to-night, we shall have
our supper with us. There&#8217;s some consolation in
that. I don&#8217;t believe the Professor will show up
again before to-morrow morning. He may have
his invention completed by that time, but everything
must remain guesswork for awhile.&#8221;</p>

<p>Under the propulsion of the paddle the light
craft skimmed swiftly over the placid lake. Dick
put forth all his skill and the canoe touched the
shingle a few minutes later and both stepped
ashore and drew the boat up the shore.</p>

<p>&#8220;It strikes me, Harv, that it will be better for us
to separate. We don&#8217;t know whether to hunt for
Bunk at the place where the Professor halted
awhile ago, or to look for him farther over to
the right where I have seen his machine several
times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say that the spot you saw is most
likely the right one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So it seems to me, but the afternoon is so far
gone that we shall need every minute and we
mustn&#8217;t go too far astray. It&#8217;s a safe guess that
one of us will establish communication with Bunk
pretty soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Further discussion made it seem that the section<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
selected by Dick was about a fourth of a mile to
the east of the other. Thus it would not become
necessary for them to lose mutual touch. Like all
boys accustomed to hunt and wander together in
the woods, they had a system of signaling by
means of whistling. Bunk was also familiar with
the code. The three had made their wishes known
when a mile apart.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you find him,&#8221; said Dick, &#8220;whistle three
times and I&#8217;ll do the same if I succeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose both fail?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When it becomes too dark to hunt longer, I&#8217;ll
call to you; you will answer in our usual way and
each will tramp toward the other. Then we&#8217;ll
make camp and start in again at daybreak.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was agreed that in case either met the Professor
or ran into danger and needed help, he
would summon it by five or six short sharp blasts
from his lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have your rifle and I only my revolver, so
I shall be more likely to need you,&#8221; said Harvey
as the brothers parted company.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV.<br />


A NATURAL PRISON.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">OUR young friend Harvey Hamilton often
recalled the words of Detective Simmons
Pendar. One remark impressed him
when his course diverged from that of his brother,
and they passed from the sight of each other.
Whenever a crime or bit of wrongdoing comes to
light, the officers whose duty it is to bring the
guilty ones to justice proceed to formulate their
theories. Their guesswork is often ingenious to
the degree of brilliancy, and an error seems impossible.
The skeins when unraveled must make
clear everything as was promised at the beginning.</p>

<p>And yet it not infrequently comes about that the
whole theory turns out to be a rope of sand. It
crumbles and truth assumes a wholly new guise.
The brothers had done a good deal of guessing and
might be far astray. It seemed to them that the
missing Bohunkus Johnson would be found either
near the spot where Professor Morgan had made
his last descent and rise, or at the other place not
far off where Dick Hamilton had seen the monoplane
more than once. And still it was possible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
that the colored youth was not within miles of
either locality.</p>

<p>Since, however, the two had no other basis
upon which to act, they promptly set out to test
the truth of their guesses. Although they were
not far from settlements, towns, villages and
camps of visitors in the wilderness, both straightway
plunged into the wildest section of the
southern Adirondacks. Harvey found the steeply
ascending surface so precipitous that it was often
hard work to force his way forward. Rarely
could he do so in a straight line, and he was obliged
to make many long, laborious detours, but he had
a fine perception of direction, and a glance at the
lake and country behind him prevented any confusion
of the points of the compass. So arduous
was his work that a full hour passed before he
believed he was near the spot where the monoplane
last halted. He was in doubt for some time, but
finally identified the vast pile of rocks, with the
exuberant growth of underbrush and trees only
a little way beyond.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the place,&#8221; he decided, after some time
spent in inspection; &#8220;over yonder is where the
machine was hidden from sight for awhile. I am
sure I am not mistaken, though it remains to be
seen whether the discovery will do any good.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>Nothing striking was observed when he looked
around. Working his way to the right of the pile
of stones, his eye rested upon an open space only
a few rods in area, just beyond and between the
rocks and the trunks of the trees. The decayed
leaves on the bottom proved that not long before
vegetation had taken root in the spot, but some
cause which he did not understand had obliterated
all traces of it.</p>

<p>An examination of the ground showed a disturbance
of the leaves as if made by the feet of a
person, and closer scrutiny disclosed where the
small rubber-tired wheels of the monoplane had
pressed. Unquestionably the young aviator had
come upon the place for which he was searching.</p>

<p>But where was Bohunkus Johnson? Harvey
saw nothing to suggest a cavern or the rudest kind
of shelter. He groped here and there, but the
search was unavailing. It might be, however, that
the machine had descended at this point because
no other near at hand would serve.</p>

<p>Harvey had hesitated through a strange dread
of disappointment to appeal to the help that was
his from the first. He now inserted his thumb and
forefinger between his lips and sent out two
resounding blasts which were twice repeated, the
last closing with a queer tremolo that may be said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
to have been the highest attainment of the art of
signaling. Only he, his brother and Bunk had
mastered this crowning achievement.</p>

<p>&#8220;If that reaches Bunk&#8217;s ears he will know from
whom it comes,&#8221; reflected Harvey in the attitude
of intense listening.</p>

<p>From some point a long way off sounded the
faint report of a gun; he heard the shout of a
person answered by that of another; the soft
breeze rustled the foliage overhead, but there was
nothing more. Then he again repeated the calls,
but in vain; not the slightest suggestion of a reply
was returned.</p>

<p>Harvey&#8217;s depressing dread was that his colored
friend had heard the call and refused to reply. It
might be he refrained through fear of the Professor,
whom he held in abject awe, or possibly he was so
obsessed by the trip to Africa that he was resolute
not to allow any interference by his friends.
Finally Harvey muttered:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe he is within reach of my signals;
it will be the fortune of Dick to bring him out from
cover.&#8221;</p>

<p>A possibility occurred to the young aviator. If
Bunk had heard his call he would set out on a
stealthy search for Harvey. He would steal like
a red Indian through the undergrowth, around the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
rocks and among the tree trunks in the effort to
gain a peep at the one who had followed him to his
lonely retreat. Harvey stood motionless, listening
and peering around for some minutes, and then,
hearing nothing more than he had heard from the
first, he started on a little search of his own.</p>

<p>Feeling the necessity of the utmost caution, he
inched around to the rear of the ledge, halting at
every step and peering into the labyrinth of undergrowth
and tree trunks, many of which grew close
to one another as if crowded for room. When he
reached the spot he had in mind, a thrill ran
through him, for he assuredly heard something
moving apparently with the same care he was
himself using. He stood motionless and listened.</p>

<p>The noise was so faint that for a time he could
not tell the direction whence it came. He was in
the midst of a dense growth of bushes, woven
through in many places by matted vines which
at times blocked his way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bunk was always good at this business,&#8221; he
reflected; &#8220;I remember he used to trace me and
Dick and dodge us when we were hunting for him.
I don&#8217;t believe he has detected me, but may suspect
I am looking for him. Sh! there it is again.&#8221;</p>

<p>This time he identified the point from which the
indistinct rustling issued. It was to the left and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
perhaps a hundred feet away. The intervening
growth made his view uncertain, but while gazing
he saw some bushes agitated, as they might have
been by a person stealing through them. He
noticed that the very gentle breeze which was
blowing came from the spot toward him, whereat
he was glad, for he fancied his own movements
were not so likely to be noticed by Bunk, provided
it was really he who was so near.</p>

<p>Fearful of being discovered before he could get
nigh enough to the colored youth to prevent his
running off, Harvey took several guarded steps,
which placed him behind the trunk of a large oak,
and peered out.</p>

<p>The rustling ceased; then he heard it again and
saw the bushes stirred. He thought this was a
most peculiar way of acting on the part of his
friend. After waiting until it had lasted several
minutes without any change, he grew impatient.
He stepped from behind the oak and advanced,
keenly watching the bushes in front.</p>

<p>Suddenly an immense pair of antlers loomed to
view amid the dense shrubbery and Harvey
observed the head of a huge buck which was
browsing upon a species of berry that grew on the
upper part of a group of bushes. The direction of
the wind prevented the animal from scenting the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
nearness of an enemy, but he had discovered something
that roused his suspicion. He stopped
chewing and holding his head high stared around
in quest of the cause.</p>

<p>Harvey did not think of screening himself from
sight of the buck, and immediately recalled the
accounts Dick had written home of the huge
creature for whose antlers he yearned.</p>

<p>&#8220;This must be the fellow; I don&#8217;t suppose he
would mind such a weapon as my revolver, even
if it wasn&#8217;t against the law to shoot his kind at this
season, but Til give him a good scare for making
me think he was Bunk.&#8221;</p>

<p>With which the youth flung up his arms, uttered
a loud &#8220;Whoof!&#8221; and bounded through the undergrowth
toward the buck. Instead of making off
in a panic, the animal looked for a moment at the
approaching form, and then lowering his head
charged straight at it.</p>

<p>This was turning the tables with a vengeance.
Harvey Hamilton had set out to hunt a magnificent
buck only to awake suddenly to the fact that the
buck was hunting him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jingo! I didn&#8217;t expect that!&#8221; exclaimed our
young friend, whirling round and dashing off at
headlong speed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if he can climb a tree,&#8221; was the next<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
thought of the panic-stricken youth, who, without
drawing the small weapon, which would have been
practically useless, glanced hurriedly around for
a refuge. He had precious little time to spare, for
the brute was crashing down upon him like a
runaway locomotive on a down grade.</p>

<p>A few paces away the fugitive thought he saw
what he longed for, in the shape of a limb as thick
as his arm, which put out at right angles from a
trunk eight or ten feet above the ground. He
could leap upward, catch hold and swing himself
above the branch, but while running with might
and main it suddenly occurred to him that the
support was too low, and the towering antlers
would overtake him before he could scramble out
of their reach.</p>

<p>He heard the superb terror so close on his heels
that, after running a few paces farther, he glanced
over his shoulder to learn how many more seconds
he had to live. As he did so, his foot caught in a
wirelike vine which wound along the ground and
he sprawled forward on his hands and knees.</p>

<p>Harvey not only fell but kept on falling. He
had struck the edge of a ravine down which he
shot so abruptly that he was gone beyond the
power of checking himself, before he knew what
was happening. He felt he was sinking and flung<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
out his hands in a desperate effort to save himself,
though he might well have questioned whether he
was not fortunate after all in the promised escape
from his infuriated pursuer. He gripped bush after
bush, but in every instance it was uprooted and
remained in his hands or gave way to others which
he seized and which in their turn yielded to the
strain. Then came the terrifying thought that
the buck would tumble down upon him and crush
out the breath of life.</p>

<p>Harvey was absolutely helpless. He might have
been badly hurt by his fall had not his attempts to
stop his descent so broken its force that when he
suddenly landed on his feet he was only slightly
jarred. In the same moment that this occurred,
he plunged to one side so as to be out of the way
of the avalanche which he expected from above.</p>

<p>But the buck was wiser in his way than the
young aviator. Stillness followed the involuntary
descent of the latter, and then the animal was
heard threshing through the undergrowth. Whatever
intentions he had held regarding the lad were
given up and he went off.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder whether any fellow ever had a stranger
escape,&#8221; reflected Harvey, when he realized
that he had nothing more to dread from the brute;
&#8220;he would have had me sure but for that tumble.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>The fear that the buck might be waiting in the
vicinity held Harvey listening for some minutes.
He was disturbed by the thought that his foe
might find a path into the gorge and still have it
out with him, but nothing of the kind occurred.</p>

<p>When finally he felt it safe to move about, he set
out to learn his real situation, and the result was
disquieting. His first thought was that the gap
through which he had been precipitated was a
ravine out of which he could climb with little
difficulty; but to his dismay he found that it was
a pocket or hole, which might be compared to an
immense irregular well, twenty or thirty feet in
diameter, with a depth nearly as great. The
inclosing walls were of rock not only perpendicular
but in several places the top narrowed, thus
leaving the bottom broader than above. Only in
one spot did the bushes grow to the edge, and
that was where he had fallen, bringing so much
undergrowth with him that he was not harmed.</p>

<p>Having made an inspection of his rocky prison,
the all-important question presented itself: How
was he to get out of it?</p>

<p>His hope was that by grasping the projecting
bits of stone, he could climb to the upper edge, but
the more he studied the problem the harder it
seemed. There was one place where he finally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
decided to make the attempt. He believed he
could raise himself to the top, but for the fact that
about half way thither, the wall protruded in a
way to suggest in a modified form the feat of
treading a ceiling after the manner of a fly.</p>

<p>This slope, however, was so moderate and so
short that he believed he might succeed. He was
not encumbered with luggage and his outer coat
had been left by the lakeside with the canoe and
the fish which he and his brother had counted
upon to furnish them their evening meal. The
field glass being suspended by a cord behind his
shoulders was no handicap; arms and legs were
free to do their best, and few youths of his age were
more capable athletes than he. The longer he
studied the situation, the higher his hopes rose.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV.<br />


A DISMAL NIGHT.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BEFORE making an attempt to climb out of
the flinty &#8220;pocket&#8221; Harvey Hamilton
studied his situation again, weakly hoping
he could discover a more favorable spot for the
essay upon which so much depended.</p>

<p>&#8220;This must be more than a hole in the ground,&#8221;
he decided, &#8220;for if it weren&#8217;t, it would be filled with
water from the rains and melting snow.&#8221;</p>

<p>His supposition was right. It would be more
proper to speak of the trap in which he was caught
as an expansion of a gorge. On one side a fissure
reached from the bottom to the top, with a similar
opening opposite. Peeping through these in turn,
Harvey noted that the channel beyond widened to
several feet. Thus a torrent of water rushing
through the ravine from the higher level, would
find an outlet on the other side of the expansion
and in a miniature way the wonderfully picturesque
&#8220;Gorge of the Aare&#8221; would be reproduced.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, if either was a little wider!&#8221; mourned
Harvey, after vainly trying to wedge his body
through the narrow openings; &#8220;it would be fun to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
follow the ravine to its outlet or to some spot where
I could find a ladder up the side, but that can&#8217;t be.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus far nothing in the nature of fear had disturbed
the young aviator. Several hours of daylight
remained and he was confident that by
bestirring himself, or, if necessary, calling for help,
he would be extricated from his vexatious situation.
He came back to the place upon which he had
fixed his hopes and girded himself for the effort.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could do it if it wasn&#8217;t for that bulge,&#8221; he
said to himself, glancing aloft, &#8220;though the wall
happens to be higher there than anywhere else.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grasping a rocky projection with one hand, he
found a resting place for his feet and pulled himself
upward for ten or a dozen inches. Looking
over either shoulder he had a partial view of his
groping shoes which after awhile found a resting
place, and then he made another hitch. This was
comparatively easy work, and if it would only
last he could climb out as readily as if ascending
the stairs at home. But nature delights in irregularity,
and when she built the steps in the side of
the gorge she did not consult the convenience of
anyone.</p>

<p>As has been stated the inward thrust of the wall
began at about half the height from the bottom.
The slope was so slight that it might have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
overcome, had the projections occurred at the
right intervals and had they been big enough to
give a secure foot or handhold. With the utmost
pains Harvey closed his fingers around the support,
one in each hand and began groping with the toes of
his shoes. He recalled the configuration over
which he had passed, and succeeded in thrusting
the front of his right shoe into a crevice, but was
unable to find a rest for the other foot. Once the
toe caught, but the instant he bore upon it the shoe
slipped free and beat the air. The rattling fragments
showed that he had struck a spot where the
shale was too rotten to be depended upon.</p>

<p>At his waist a horizontal fissure had served for
his hands. If he could lift his feet sufficiently to
use it and gain another support above, it would be
of vast help, but he must first secure an upper hold.
Looking aloft he saw a ledge that he thought
would answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it gives way or my hands slip I shall fall,&#8221;
he concluded, after studying the task, &#8220;but it&#8217;s my
only hope and here goes.&#8221;</p>

<p>He bent his knees slightly and leaped upward.
His calculation was made so nicely that he caught
the projecting ledge, and had nearly worked his
shoes into the lower opening, when the shale in his
grasp broke as if it were a decayed limb, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
unable to stay his descent, he dropped to the bottom
of the gorge. The distance was not sufficient
to harm him much, though he was considerably
jarred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Confound it!&#8221; he exclaimed, chagrined and
angered; &#8220;if I could have passed that spot I
should have reached the top.&#8221;</p>

<p>He wondered whether it was worth while to try
it again, but decided there was no reason to expect
success. Even if he could climb beyond the place
of his mishap, new obstacles would check him.</p>

<p>&#8220;As it was, I fell as far as I care to tumble;
that is about all I&#8217;ve been doing,&#8221; he grimly added,
&#8220;since that plaguy buck took a shy at me. If a
fellow could only fall upward, there would be a
chance for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the first time since his slip he asked himself
how this affair was to end. He was sure he had
nothing to fear as to the final outcome.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dick will wait where he is, if he gets on the
track of Bunk; he will signal me to go to him, and
when I don&#8217;t come, he will head this way. He
knows the spot near enough to come within hail
and the rest will be easy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more his thoughts reverted to Bunk.
While the fellow might keep out of his reach, so
long as he believed Harvey was trying to prevent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
his trip with Professor Morgan, and while he
undoubtedly would resent such interference, it
would be far different when he learned that Harvey
was in trouble. The dusky youth would
abandon everything and rush to his rescue. None
knew this better than Harvey Hamilton himself,
and he wondered whether there was not some way
of apprising Bunk of his dilemma.</p>

<p>&#8220;At any rate, it&#8217;s worth trying,&#8221; was the conclusion
which he proceeded straightway to act
upon.</p>

<p>Instead of whistling as he had done before,
Harvey shouted the name of his friend and added
in the loudest voice at his command the emphatic
declaration that he was in a hole and wished Bunk
to come and help him out. The appeal, if heard,
was certain to bring results, but the truth forced
itself upon the supplicant, that the voice of a person
at the bottom of a well thirty feet or so in depth
cannot be made to carry far. Bunk might be
within two or three hundred yards and yet not
hear him.</p>

<p>Harvey kept up his appeals until he grew hoarse,
but without bringing the rescue for which he so
ardently hoped. Help was beyond reach and he
must depend upon other means to free himself
from prison.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>If you can imagine his situation, you will understand
how hard it was for him to stay idle. To
fold one&#8217;s hands and wait for the assistance that
is likely to be delayed for an indefinite time, is
impossible for a lad in the vigor of health and
strength. By this time he had formed the conviction
that Bunk was nowhere near. It was the
brother who had gone to the right spot to find
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;From the way Bunk has acted all along he will
fight shy of Dick; even if he doesn&#8217;t know what his
errand is, he will try to avoid meeting him. Besides,
my brother won&#8217;t know how to handle him,
as I should in his place.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having given up hope of climbing out of the
gorge by the means already tried, Harvey inspected
the other portions more minutely. He studied
the path by which he had made his hasty descent
when running from the buck. There was a luxuriant
growth of shrubbery on the upper edge,
through which he had fallen, bringing down
several handfuls with him. The roots were so
weak that they simply broke his fall without checking
his downward course.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder whether I can get enough support
to allow me to climb out there. A bush is within
reach that looks as if it might hold. I&#8217;ll try it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>By standing on tiptoe he grasped the top, upon
which he began slowly pulling until he lifted himself
clear. Then with the same patience he drew
himself up several feet, when he had to let go and
grip the bush above. This did not look so strong,
but it held and he climbed two or three feet farther.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall make it,&#8221; he thought with a thrill of
hope; &#8220;if the next will stand it and several after
that, I shall get to the top.&#8221;</p>

<p>But that was what did not take place. He had
caught hold of the third support when it instantly
came out by the roots, and he tumbled again,
landing upon his back, though still without hurt,
for the distance was slight.</p>

<p>The last attempt convinced Harvey that he was
so securely trapped that he was utterly unable to
help himself. Irksome as was the task he could
do nothing but await the arrival of his brother.</p>

<p>Before his encounter with the buck, he had had
a long tramp through the wilderness and he had
toiled so hard to liberate himself, that he was tired
in body. He sat down at the base of the bushes
that had failed him and thought over the situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I had come into the mountains alone,&#8221; he
reflected with a shudder, &#8220;nothing but heaven
could save me from starving to death. I can&#8217;t get
out and there isn&#8217;t a bit of food or a drop of water<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
within reach. If anything should happen to Dick,
it will be the end of me. But what could happen
to him?&#8221; he asked in a sharp effort to drive away
the frightful thought. &#8220;He is looking for Bunk
and will keep it up till night, when he&#8217;ll set out to
look for me. He knows where to come and won&#8217;t
be long about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus Harvey sat in melancholy reflection until
the gathering gloom told him the day was drawing
to a close and night was closing in. Despite his
natural hopefulness, he could not fight off a depression
of spirits, which after all was natural in
the circumstances. He was alone in a vast solitude,
no one could hear his calls for help, and Dick
might hunt for hours without finding him.</p>

<p>With his nerves strained to the tensest point,
Harvey suddenly heard something move in the
bushes at the top of the wall and directly above his
head. The suspicion that it might be a wild
animal likely to tumble down upon him caused
him to leave his place and station himself on
the opposite side of the gorge, where he drew his
revolver and stood ready to defend himself if
attacked.</p>

<p>Something was certainly stirring above. He
caught the rustling at intervals, with pauses that
lasted so long that he believed the creature, whatever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
it might be, had left the spot. Suddenly it
occurred to the youth that it might be his brother
or some person.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello up there!&#8221; he called; &#8220;is that you
Dick, or Bunk?&#8221;</p>

<p>The fact that no reply was returned satisfied
Harvey that it was neither of his friends. Hoping
it might be a man, he added in the same distinct
voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;I fell down here this afternoon and can&#8217;t get
out unless somebody gives me a lift.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harvey heard the rustling again, but nothing
more. It was some kind of a wild animal prowling
in the vicinity.</p>

<p>&#8220;He may be looking for a meal and is trying to
decide upon the best way of attacking me,&#8221; added
the youth, keeping a sharp watch, with his weapon
tightly grasped.</p>

<p>A chill ran over him at the belief that he caught
the glint of a pair of eyes peering through the dusk,
but if so they were withdrawn, and the fact that
he heard nothing more made him suspect he had
been mistaken. His imagination was so wrought
up that he saw things which did not exist.</p>

<p>By and by the all-pervading darkness shut out
everything from sight. He could not discern the
rugged margin of the gorge that had become so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
familiar to him. There was a growing chilliness
in the air which would have made his extra coat
welcome. He thought of gathering enough sticks
to start a fire, but recalled that all the fuel within
reach was green and it would be almost impossible
to kindle it. Besides, though wild animals dread
a too close contact with flames, he feared the light
would attract some of them to the spot. Even if
he could set a blaze going, he could not maintain it
long, and then the turn of his enemies would come.
Accordingly, he gave over all intention of trying to
brighten up his sombre surroundings.</p>

<p>The bottom of the gorge was free from dampness,
for rain had not fallen for a long time, and had
the circumstances been different Harvey might
have passed the night in comparative comfort.
He could not bring himself to lie down, but assumed
a sitting position with his back against the wall.
He was opposite the spot down which he had
tumbled. Somehow he felt that if danger came
it would be from that point, and he intended to be
prepared for it.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no possibility of my falling asleep; I
am too nervous. I don&#8217;t understand what keeps
Dick away,&#8221; he added petulantly, for he had
reached anything but a pleasant frame of mind, in
which he conjured up many causes that might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
explain his brother&#8217;s absence. Aside from the
difficulty he was likely to find in bringing Bunk to
terms, he himself might have met with accident.
The fact that he carried a rifle was no guarantee
against the very mishap that had befallen Harvey
himself.</p>

<p>It would be hours before the moon rose and
though the sky was clear and the orb was near
the full, the foliage was too abundant to permit
its light to reach him. In the hope that Dick
might be moving about not far off, the imprisoned
young aviator shouted his name at intervals. He
ceased to call for Bunk, for he no longer felt any
hope that he was in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>When a young man sits on the ground with his
back against a support and in an easy posture, and
is absolutely certain that he will stay wide awake
until morning, such a belief is generally soon
followed by profound slumber. Such was the
case with Harvey Hamilton, who would have
remained unconscious throughout the darkness
had he not been roused in the most startling
manner conceivable.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI.<br />


DICK IS TEMPTED.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">YOU will remember that Dick Hamilton was
not only a sophomore in Yale University,
but had attained his twenty-first year. He
was warranted therefore in looking upon himself
as a full-grown man, while in his mind his brother
Harvey was only a &#8220;kid.&#8221; He treated him as
such, but was none the less fond of him. It need
not be added that Dick had a strong affection for
Bohunkus Johnson because of his simplicity,
honesty, unfailing good nature and love for the
two brothers. Consequently when the elder
learned of the singular peril in which the colored
lad had fallen through no fault of his own, he was
as resolute as Harvey that he should be saved if
the task was within the range of accomplishment.</p>

<p>But he took an impulsive man&#8217;s view of the situation.
He was impatient with the regard shown
the crazy inventor, Professor Morgan, and what
he looked upon as awe and fear on the part of
Harvey.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll end this monkey business when I gain the
chance,&#8221; he reflected, after parting from his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
brother on the shore of the lake. &#8220;Let me once
get within reach of Bunk and I&#8217;ll yank him back
to common sense quicker than he can say Jack
Robinson. If he objects, I&#8217;ll wipe the ground
with him, and if Harv makes a kick I&#8217;ll serve him
the same way. As for the lunatic, if he can&#8217;t be
bluffed I&#8217;ll use other means. He ought to be
jugged where he can&#8217;t get a chance to run off with
such numskulls as Bunk. All I want is a show.&#8221;</p>

<p>Which it may be said was all that Harvey
wanted. Dick was confident that if he could once
reach the colored lad all trouble would be over.
But that was the crux of the situation: Bunk had
not yet been found.</p>

<p>The elder Hamilton was sure that he was on his
way to where the colored youth was a prisoner.
And it was because of that confidence that he sent
Harvey on his wild-goose chase.</p>

<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t get near Bunk. If he does, the wild
man may drop down on both and raise the dickens
with them. I should like to see him try it with me.
I told Harv that I knew the section where I had
seen him come down in his monoplane more than
once, but I didn&#8217;t tell him that I know pretty
nearly the exact spot. If the court knows herself
and she thinks she do, that spot is whither my
footsteps are now tending.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>It came about that the paths pursued by the
brothers diverged more than the younger suspected.
Instead of leading to points a fourth of
a mile apart, the distance between them was
fully double that.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I shouldn&#8217;t mind if the Professor arrived
just behind me and tried to butt in. If he does
I&#8217;ll make things lively for him. I haven&#8217;t had
any special exercise since my boxing bout with
big Burt Thompson and I should like to have a
little fun with a full-grown man.&#8221;</p>

<p>From which it will appear that the elder Hamilton
held views which, to say the least, would have
surprised his brother.</p>

<p>To Dick all seemed plain sailing, but such did
not prove the fact. Having his destination clearly
in mind he went straight to it. The place was
similar in several respects to that visited by Harvey;
but after a little search among the rocks, he came
upon a cavern, which extended twenty feet back,
with half that width and height, and the entire
front open. It would serve well as a shelter during
a storm but a fire would become necessary in
cold weather.</p>

<p>One comprehensive glance showed that some
one had occupied this primitive retreat during the
past few days. The flinty floor was strewn with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
bones, bits of dry bread, pieces of paper that had
evidently served for wrapping, bottles, and other
debris which suggested that a party of picnickers
had recently made use of it. At the rear was a
single rumpled blanket that no doubt had served
for a bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is Bunk&#8217;s home,&#8221; was the conclusion
of the visitor, after his survey. &#8220;The Professor
has warned him not to wander off, and
keeps him supplied with the necessaries of life,
which, knowing Bunk&#8217;s appetite as I do, is no
small job.&#8221;</p>

<p>So much being conceded, Dick looked around
for the occupant, satisfied that he must be near.
Not seeing him, he raised his voice, as his brother
did some time later at the other place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come here, Bunk!&#8221; he called; &#8220;come a-running
too, for if you don&#8217;t I&#8217;ll lambaste you out of
your three and a half senses!&#8221;</p>

<p>When the summons had been repeated several
times without results it occurred to Dick that he
had been somewhat hasty. Gentler means might
have prevailed. He decided that it might be well
to appeal to the affectionate side of Bunk&#8217;s nature,
by calling out that Mr. and Mrs. Hartley were
dead, that Harvey had fallen down stairs and
broken his neck, and that Dick himself was not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
feeling well; but he decided to retain this stupendous
bluff as a last reserve.</p>

<p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t be far off,&#8221; continued the young man,
fast losing patience. Enough light entered the
cavern from the front to show the interior clearly,
but to make sure, he jerked the blanket from the
stone floor and peeped under it, where a mouse
would not have found room to hide itself. Then
he strode outside and glanced sharply toward the
different points of the compass.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll shake him till his teeth rattle for doing
this,&#8221; muttered Dick; &#8220;I believe he is watching
me all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>The conviction forced itself upon Dick Hamilton
stronger than ever that he had taken a wrong
method of dealing with the African youth. He
ought to have waited until the fellow was within
reach before being so emphatic. Bunk must have
detected the approach of his old friend and hidden
himself. The chances of doing this successfully
were so numerous that it was useless for Dick to
hunt for him. He must decide upon his next step.</p>

<p>He would have shouted out the fiction of misfortune
having overtaken Harvey, thus appealing
to the friendship of Bunk, had he not believed it
was too late to adopt the subterfuge. The colored
lad would see through the trick.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>The only recourse that occurred to Dick was
to pretend he had given up the search and go
away as if to return to camp. He therefore called:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good bye, Bunk; when you get back from
Africa you must tell us about your trip. I wish
you good luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no response and he did not expect
any. He picked his way through the undergrowth
and among the trees and rocks, heading
toward the lake, but soon changed his course with
the purpose of joining Harvey a half mile distant.
He would have preferred to notify him of his
approach by whistling, but the signal most likely
would have been heard by Bunk and would put
him on his guard.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can reach Harv without trouble and he and
I will fix upon a plan.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man was so impatient with Bunk
that he longed for the chance to punish him for his
foolishness.</p>

<p>&#8220;He holds that Professor in deadly fear, and
is more afraid of offending him than of vexing us.
I can understand how such a crank with his wild,
magnetic eyes can gain a hypnotic power over the
simple fellow, but he ought to throw off the spell
when he knows the man is a long distance away
and we are near him.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>The route was so rough that Dick, who did not
hurry, spent a long time in traversing it. He had
gone the greater part of the way when a threshing
in the underwood in advance brought him to an
abrupt halt. He sprang behind the nearest tree
and held his Winchester ready for use. He knew
from the peculiar racket that an animal of some
kind was approaching. As in the case of his
brother, the gentle breeze was in his favor and the
brute as yet was unaware of his presence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be hanged!&#8221;</p>

<p>The very buck about which he had written home
in glowing terms, and which he had seen several
times in the neighborhood, was stalking through
the brush like a forest monarch, his course such
that unless alarmed, he must pass within a few
paces of the young hunter.</p>

<p>The temptation to bag the prize was almost
resistless. Dick had only to reach out his hand,
as may be said, to seize the treasure. With the
deadly weapon in his grasp and many shots at
command, he could drop the gigantic animal in
his tracks. It would be easy to remove the magnificent
antlers, hide them among the rocks, and
return for them weeks later when the season was
open. After that he would fill his classmates
with rank unbearable jealousy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>It was natural perhaps that Dick Hamilton
should fall back upon the specious reasoning
which comes to him who meditates breaking the
law. How can it be right to shoot an elk or deer
on the sixteenth of September, and wrong to do
so on the fifteenth? Can the simple wording of
a statute decide the question? Of course not. Besides,
none of the game protectors were near and
at the most Dick would be compelled only to pay
a big fine, for which the accommodating &#8220;governor&#8221;
would readily stand.</p>

<p>It has been said that, as to the question of free
moral agency, a logician may argue so subtly as to
convince his hearers that such a thing is impossible.
And yet there always remains one person whom
he cannot convince, and that person is himself.
So it came about that Dick&#8217;s conscience would not
down. He could not hush the still small voice.</p>

<p>Twenty yards away the buck was warned by
his strange instinct that danger was in the air.
He came to a halt, his big brown body only partially
disclosed among the foliage, but when he
reared his head, that and the glorious crown of
curving prongs rose in relief against the emerald
background. It was an ideal target and Dick
Hamilton in a tremor brought his rifle to his
shoulder. Slight as was the movement and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
imperceptible the noise, the buck wheeled and
fled on the instant. Just then the youth should
have pressed the trigger, but instead he lowered
his weapon.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do it!&#8221; he said, compressing his lips;
&#8220;it isn&#8217;t out of mercy for you, my fine fellow, but
because the law says &#8216;No!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>It will be understood that the buck had finished
with the younger brother, who escaped his knife-like
hoofs through accident. The query naturally
occurs as to why the creature should run toward
one youth and away from the other. Ask any
veteran or amateur hunter, and he will answer that
it was because in one case the biped had a deadly
weapon and in the other he had not. It sounds
absurd, but you can never make a ranger of the
woods believe that the game animals do not govern
their actions in accordance with the open and
close seasons.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must be real good,&#8221; said Dick Hamilton
airily as he resumed his tramp, &#8220;thus to crush my
fondest hopes and dash away the tempting cup
held to my lips, but all the same, I almost wish I
had dropped that fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time he was so much nearer Harvey than
to Bohunkus that Dick emitted the signal to which
all were accustomed. He hardly expected a reply<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
and did not receive any, the singular situation
being that at that very moment the brothers were
issuing their calls and yet neither could hear the
other. Harvey&#8217;s location at the bottom of the
gorge shut in his voice and signals and shut out
those of Dick. Had the former been standing
above the gorge where only trees and brush intervened,
the two would have come together in a brief
while.</p>

<p>Despite the assurance of Dick, he wandered from
the course he intended to follow. It will be
remembered that the region was strange to him
and he had no guiding landmarks. When he
awoke to the unpleasant fact night was closing in.
He did not know what direction to take to reach
Harvey and signaled repeatedly, but inasmuch
as he was a good deal farther off than in the first
place, it need not be said that his calls failed to
reach the ears for which they were meant. He
strove to regain his bearings, and since he was
able to locate the lake and saw the glimmer of the
camp fire beyond, he accomplished much in the
way of correcting his course.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder whether anything has happened to
Harv,&#8221; he mused, with a vague uneasiness stealing
over him; &#8220;I don&#8217;t see what could have harmed
him, for he has his Colt and no animals in this part<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
of the world will attack a fellow in his situation.
He is too used to tramping through the woods to
fall over the rocks or to tumble into any chasm.&#8221;</p>

<p>Little did the elder brother suspect how near
he had hit upon the truth.</p>

<p>Satisfied that he was on the right course, Dick
pressed on until the darkness became too deep
for him to see his way. He halted and peered
around in the starlight, but his vision was too
obstructed to give any satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;As nearly as I can figure out I am pretty near
the spot. If I am right, why in the mischief
doesn&#8217;t he answer me?&#8221;</p>

<p>He raised his voice once more and shouted and
whistled. In this instance Harvey would have
made reply but for the fact that he was asleep.
All through the racket he slumbered as serenely as
if in his own bed at home.</p>

<p>Dick, with his hands extended in front, one
grasping his Winchester, groped forward, careful
where he placed each foot in turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say that I fancy this work. If I don&#8217;t
bump against Harv pretty soon I&#8217;ll give it up for
the night.</p>

<p>&#8220;What the deuce&mdash;&#8221; he abruptly exclaimed as
he felt himself sinking downward.</p>

AN UNCEREMONIOUS ARRIVAL.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">BY a remarkable coincidence Dick Hamilton
trod in the very steps of his brother Harvey
while groping about the gorge, and went
crashing and tumbling to the bottom in the precise
fashion of his predecessor.</p>

<p>Retaining his grasp on his Winchester, he
strove desperately to check his descent, but
from the causes mentioned failed and landed
on his feet, bewildered and unable for the
moment to comprehend what had taken place.
The racket and his exclamations roused Harvey,
who was so mystified that he whipped out his
revolver and fired a shot in the direction of
the noise without being able to discern his
target.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop that!&#8221; shouted the elder; &#8220;you may hit
me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heavens, Dick, is it you?&#8221; demanded the
younger.</p>

<p>Finding himself unharmed, Dick&#8217;s waggery
asserted itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know who else it is. That&#8217;s the way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
I always come downstairs. What are you doing
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Waiting to welcome you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A pretty way to receive a long lost brother
by shooting at him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t harm you, did I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not, for you aimed at me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How could I do that when I didn&#8217;t see you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All the same in both cases. But I say, Harv,
what does all this mean? It&#8217;s the queerest mix up
I ever ran into.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The same with me; I tumbled down that bank
while picking my way along the edge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You see the effect of a bad example. How
long have you been here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems about a month, but I guess it is only
a few hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you answer my signals?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For the same reason that you didn&#8217;t answer
mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I was so near when I last called that you
ought to have heard me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I should if I hadn&#8217;t been asleep. You
woke me rather suddenly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t help it; you might have put up a
notice warning me to look out. But I say, Harv,
what sort of a hotel is this?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>&#8220;One that I should like very much to leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why haven&#8217;t you done so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t; I wish you would show me the way
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take the first door you come to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there isn&#8217;t any door; I tried to bid farewell
until I had to give it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harvey now told the particulars of his mishap.
The gloom was so deep that neither could see even
the outlines of the other. But their hands met
and both were thankful over their escape, though
their situation was anything but enviable. Dick
drew out his match safe and held the tiny flame
above his head. As the reflection lighted each
face, they laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;We set out to find Bunk,&#8221; said the elder,
&#8220;and now it&#8217;s up to him to find us. You say
you know of no way of climbing out of this gorge?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not unless some one gives us help. I have
tried it over and over again, and shouted until I
was hoarse, but without any one hearing me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly did not. Now instead of one young
Hamilton in a hole there are two. That makes
the situation twice as bad as before. Why haven&#8217;t
you started a fire?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The fuel is too green.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thereby resembling us. However, we must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
find some way to leave in the morning. You see,
Harv, we haven&#8217;t our outer coats, nor any food,
nor moisture enough to wet our lips. By and by
our situation will become a bore.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is pretty near that now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Since it was certain they would have to spend
the night there, they seated themselves where
Harvey had been resting when awakened with such
startling suddenness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you learn anything of Bunk?&#8221; asked
Dick.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t get the first trace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew you wouldn&#8217;t when you left me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you make out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I found the cave where he was staying and had
a talk with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; exclaimed the amazed Harvey; &#8220;do
you tell me that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose it is hardly fair to say I had a talk
with him, being that I did all the talking and he
hadn&#8217;t a word to reply.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fact is I didn&#8217;t lay eyes on him; he kept out
of sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thereupon the elder related his experience after
the two had parted company. There was no
doubt that he had come upon the temporary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
dwelling of the missing Bohunkus, but the fellow
eluded him.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have him yet,&#8221; added Dick, &#8220;and if I
feel then as I do now, I&#8217;ll teach him a lesson he
won&#8217;t forget if he lives a thousand years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps he deserves it, though I don&#8217;t blame
him as much as you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am speaking for myself, and I&#8217;ll drop a hint
to you that it won&#8217;t be prudent to interfere. I may
be in a different mood when I reach him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember, you haven&#8217;t reached him as yet
and there&#8217;s no saying when you will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t any doubt that the morning will
show us so easy a way of getting out of this hole,
that you&#8217;ll be disgusted because you didn&#8217;t see
it at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dick&#8217;s optimism cheered Harvey. They talked
for two hours and then both succumbed to drowsiness.
They adjusted their positions so as to bring
a part of their bodies in contact, thus gaining a
slight degree of mutual warmth. While the night
continued cool they did not suffer, and the slumber
into which they sank lasted without break until
morning.</p>

<p>Dick was the first to regain his senses. Gently
moving so as not to disturb his brother he made a
minute inspection of the gorge, passing twice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
around it, and studying every spot upon which it
seemed possible to build hope. He was scrutinizing
the inward sloping wall overhead which
Harvey had tried to climb when the latter, still
seated, looked up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do you make of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must own that it looks dubious. I don&#8217;t see
any way of getting to the top. I thought of raising
you on my shoulders but that wouldn&#8217;t amount
to anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will do no good to whistle or shout, for no
one, unless near, can hear us. How long before
Hunter and Wadsworth will suspect something is
wrong and set out to hunt you up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They will probably wait for one or two weeks,
by which time we should be somewhat hungrier
and thirstier than now, though that doesn&#8217;t
seem possible. Then,&#8221; grimly added Dick,
&#8220;if they come to this spot they would probably
tumble into the gorge the same as we
did, and we should all have to die together.
I have a plan that may possibly amount to
something.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dick took his Winchester from where it leaned
against the rocks, and pointing the muzzle toward
the sky, discharged each of the ten charges with
a few seconds between them. Then he refilled the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
chamber with cartridges and waiting a few minutes,
did as before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those reports will carry farther than our
whistling or shouting, but not as far as I should
like. It depends upon whether anyone is in the
neighborhood.&#8221;</p>

<p>The experiment proved delightfully successful.
Dick Hamilton was preparing to fire a third series,
when they were thrilled by a shout:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, down there! What the blazes is the
matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>The hail came from a point behind them. On
the edge of the gorge and close to where the brothers
had fallen one after the other, stood a middle-aged
man in rough clothing and a slouch hat,
carrying a rifle. His face was smooth-shaven, and
the expression kindly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out!&#8221; Harvey shouted, &#8220;or you&#8217;ll fall
into the gorge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon I ain&#8217;t fool enough to do that,&#8221; was
his grinning reply; &#8220;is that the way you managed
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what we did,&#8221; said Dick; &#8220;be good
enough not to laugh too hard, for we feel bad
enough as it is, without your rubbing it in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do seem to be in a fix, but we can soon
get you out.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>&#8220;You have no surer way of earning our undying
gratitude,&#8221; said Dick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait where you be till I come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no fear of not waiting, but please
don&#8217;t forget to return.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>With which the man drew back and disappeared.
He was not gone long when he reappeared with
a long, slim sapling, which he had trimmed of its
nubs and excrescences except at the top. Bracing
himself firmly on another part of the edge of the
gorge, which was the lowest and gave firm footing,
he grasped the larger end of the pole and carefully
thrust the smaller part down into the opening.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you make it?&#8221; he called, peering over.</p>

<p>By standing on tiptoe Dick could grasp the
bushy end. He suggested that Harvey should go
first, but there was really no choice, and the younger
replied by telling his brother not to wait.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you ready?&#8221; asked the man above.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold fast and I&#8217;ll climb up. You needn&#8217;t
lift me.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was easy for the elder, even with his rifle in
one hand, to ascend the pole monkey fashion, and
a minute later he stood on the upper ground beside
his friend. Then he helped to hold the larger
end and Harvey climbed up with the same facility.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
The rescue was effected so readily that it was
almost ridiculous. The two warmly thanked the
stranger. Harvey offered a money reward, but
the man shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Jim Haley, one of the game protectors for
this part of the country. I heard your gun and
wondered what it meant. We have to keep sharp
watch of them as are inclined to forget this is the
close season. Why have you brought your Winchester
with you?&#8221; asked the official, with a suspicious
look at Dick.</p>

<p>&#8220;I generally carry it in the woods so as to be
ready for danger. I met a big buck yesterday;
fact is, I&#8217;ve seen him several times and he was
mighty tempting, but I haven&#8217;t any wish to get
into trouble with the courts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget that, young man, for if you do
it&#8217;ll go hard with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll remember,&#8221; meekly replied Dick, who
almost trembled to recall how near he had come
to violating the game laws; &#8220;a couple of friends and
myself have a tent on the other side of the lake.
If you will go there with us I can promise you a
good breakfast and a smoke.&#8221;</p>

<p>Haley thanked them but declined the invitation,
and bidding them good day strode off. His
manner showed that he was still a little distrustful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
of the intentions of the young man, who, it need
hardly be said, gave him and his brother officials no
further cause to suspect him.</p>

<p>&#8220;The next thing to be done,&#8221; said Dick, &#8220;is to
get back to camp for breakfast. On the way we&#8217;ll
stop long enough to lower the lake six inches in
slaking our thirst.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What about Bunk?&#8221; asked Harvey.</p>

<p>&#8220;On his account, I shall give him no attention
till after I have had a full meal. If I should run
across him before, nothing can prevent me from
murdering him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have a fine mess of fish awaiting us at the
canoe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But nothing else; we need seasoning, coffee,
biscuit and lots of other things that can&#8217;t be had
short of camp. I&#8217;ll run you a race.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if I know myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>So it came about that Bohunkus Johnson was
dismissed from their thoughts for the time, and
all their energies were given to making the trip as
quickly as possible. Dick plied the paddle with
skill and vigor. They found their friends awaiting
them and the meal which followed was all that
two hungry youths could ask.</p>

<p>While it was under way, Hunter and Wadsworth
having concluded theirs, the Hamiltons told their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
story. The morning was now well advanced and
Professor Morgan and his monoplane might appear
at any moment. The couple, who were making
ready for a tramp in the woods to the eastward,
volunteered to go with Dick and Harvey, but it
was feared that their presence might prove an
obstacle to success.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are starting for that sable gentleman in
earnest this time,&#8221; said the elder, &#8220;and what&#8217;s
more, we&#8217;re going to get him. You can bet your
last dollar on that. I&#8217;ve got a hunch to that
effect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are likely to run into a row with the Professor,&#8221;
said Hunter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing would suit me better; I have had so
much experience while in camp in dealing with
cranks that I understand &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>With good wishes the parties separated as on the
day before, and once more Dick Hamilton sent the
canoe skimming toward the extremity of the lake
He would not permit Harvey to take the paddle,
for he was less skillful. The minutes were important.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep watch for that lunatic, Harv, and leave
the rest to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The younger not only scanned the sky to the
south, but studied the mountainous country ahead.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
The greater part of the distance had been passed
when he uttered an excited exclamation.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Dick, holding his paddle
suspended and glancing over his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take a look at that pile of rocks where you
went yesterday and let me know what you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dick laid down the paddle and leveled the instrument.
A moment later he called out:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be hanged! It&#8217;s Bunk and no mistake!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII.<br />


BUNK JOINS THE PROFESSOR.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp;FEAR that our glimpses of Bohunkus Johnson
have been so vague that you think it is time
something more positive should be told. Let
us therefore give our attention to the colored youth
and make clear what befell him. It becomes
necessary to go back to that day in eastern Pennsylvania
when he parted company with Harvey
Hamilton. His extraordinary experience was
wholly due to the little tiff he had had with the
young aviator. How true it is that &#8220;great oaks
from little acorns grow.&#8221; But for that trifling
affair I should have finished my story long ago.</p>

<p>It is a hard thing to deal with a brilliant mind
gone askew, especially when the line between
sanity and insanity becomes at times indistinct,
if it does not wholly disappear. Professor Milo
Morgan was carried away by his intense interest
in aeronautics. You have learned of the remarkable
inventions he had already made in that field.
He had discovered how to make the flight of his
machine noiseless, and could remain in the air for
ten or twelve hours. Not only that, but he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
succeeded in constructing a helicopter,&mdash;that is, an
aeroplane that will rise vertically by means of the
horizontal screw or propeller beneath.</p>

<p>Having achieved all this, he became absorbed
in the scheme of remaining aloft for two days at
least. When he could do that he would be able,
while traveling at the rate of seventy-five miles an
hour, to cross the Atlantic between Quebec and
Liverpool (2600 miles) in a trifle less than a day
and a half. That his ambition was not so mad as
it may seem, I may add that, while I am writing
these lines, a professional aviator has declared that
he is certain of accomplishing the feat in the near
future. I venture to predict, that within the next
three years the trip will be made by more than
one aviator.</p>

<p>The Professor was so rapt in his work that he
thought of nothing else and became indifferent
toward every one. He cared nothing for Harvey
or Bunk or the great task of Detective Pendar.
What he did by way of aiding them may be called
side issues. The chances came in his way and he
used them as he might have used a score of others
of a different nature, with no thought or interest
or care in what should follow.</p>

<p>When the African youth came to him at the hotel
in Chesterton and asked the privilege of accompanying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
him to Africa, the proposal was promptly
accepted. It may have been that the crank took
a liking to the big, honest fellow, but it is more
probable he saw that Bohunkus would become
more than a simple passenger. The man had
felt the need of an assistant,&mdash;not a negative
person, but one who could help him in what might
be called the rough work he had in hand. It was
physical, not mental aid that he wanted while
engaged in completing his experiments with full
success in sight.</p>

<p>The Professor inquired whether Bunk was at
liberty to go with him on the long aerial voyage.
In other words must he have the permission of
young Hamilton?</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; sniffed the lad, in whose heart still
rankled resentment because of his late rebuke; &#8220;he
hain&#8217;t got nuffin to do with me; I&#8217;m my own boss
and he knows better dan to put on airs with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That being the case I will take you, but it will
be two or three days before I shall be ready to
start.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat don&#8217; make no diff&#8217;rence, so you starts
<i>some</i> time. I can wait, I reckons, till yo&#8217; am
suited.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you may have some hard work to perform
in helping me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m used to work; dat don&#8217;t scare me; jes&#8217;
tell me what yo&#8217; want done and I&#8217;ll doot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I recall something about your father being a
great chief in Africa.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat&#8217;s de fac&#8217;,&#8221; replied Bunk proudly; &#8220;he
am de greatest chief in de whole state; he&#8217;ll
treat yo&#8217; mighty well for fetching me ober to
wisit him.&#8221;</p>

<p>How Bohunkus first gained the belief that his
parent belonged to the native nobility of the Dark
Continent is interesting of itself. When he was
very small he was brought to Mr. Cecil Hartley,
the well-to-do farmer who was a neighbor of Mr.
Hamilton near Mootsport, by an aged negro who
had been a slave in the South. He said the
father of the urchin was the great chief Bohunkus
Foozleum, who was at the head of a clan numbering
thousands of warriors in Central Africa.
The old man added that the Christian name of
Bunk was Johnson, which, if a fact, is rather hard
to understand. However, Bunk was turned over
to the kind-hearted farmer and his wife, and was
known as a bound boy, though the transfer was not
accompanied by the usual legal steps.</p>

<p>The yarn of the old negro was repeated many
times in the hearing of Bunk, and the Hartleys
and Hamiltons often laughed over it. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
gravity they assumed when telling the story to
Bunk naturally caused him to believe it, and
again naturally he formed the resolution that
whenever a chance offered he would visit that
hazy country and make a call upon his royal
parent. Hence his quickness to seize what looked
like a golden opportunity.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must understand one thing from the
start,&#8221; said the Professor impressively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you enter my service there will be no turning
back,&mdash;you must go with me to the end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat soots me from de sole ob my head to de
crown ob my foot. I doan&#8217; keer if I neber come
back; being chief among dem folks am a good deal
better dan being lambasted and aboosed by white
folks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long will it take you to get ready?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Bout four seconds; all I&#8217;ve got to git am my
coat and a few little tings dat am in my room up-stairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get them then.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bunk sprang to his feet and was hurrying
through the door of the hotel when the Professor
called him back.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t tell anyone of this, especially
young Hamilton.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>&#8220;How am I gwine to tell him when he ain&#8217;t here
to tell? We&#8217;ll be half way to Afriky afore he
comes back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t write any letter and leave it here
for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Neber thought ob doing dat,&#8221; replied Bunk,
as he dived from sight and went up the stairs
three steps at a time.</p>

<p>It was just there that Professor Morgan made
his first mistake. It was true, as Bunk said, that
he had no thought of leaving any message for his
young friend, but since he had been forbidden to
do so, the temptation to disobey was irresistible.
Temporary resentment could not quench his
affection for Harvey Hamilton.</p>

<p>&#8220;When he comes back and finds me gone, he&#8217;ll
cry his eyes out; he&#8217;ll butt his head agin de wall
and call on de hotel to fall down and mash him
flat. Harv ain&#8217;t such a bad feller as some folks
think.&#8221;</p>

<p>The result of all this was that Bunk wrote his
farewell epistle in his room and had no trouble in
handing it to the landlord who, as we know, carried
out his wishes.</p>

<p>Now that the decision had been made, the
colored youth was all eagerness to start. He was
in mortal fear that Harvey would return at any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
moment. While Bunk was as resolute as ever
he did not wish to come to an open quarrel with
Harvey Hamilton.</p>

<p>Not once did a thought enter his mind that the
aviator&#8217;s brain was muddled. He looked upon
the strange person with awe and fear. While he
might disregard instructions when the eye of his
master was not upon him, nothing could have
made him do so otherwise. The Professor&#8217;s
hypnotic power was complete. By fixing those
piercing orbs upon the negro, he could readily
cast over him that strange spell which we have all
seen and which made the youth as putty in his
hands. The man did not call this ability into
play, because the need had not as yet appeared,
but he knew it was at his command whenever
he wished to use it.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re off for Afriky!&#8221; was the thrilling
thought of Bunk, when he sat back in his seat and
with swelling heart looked out into the radiant
sky and the variegated landscape sweeping under
him. Never was he so proud and never did his
heart swell with such abounding emotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t Harv feel sorry when he sees me
coming back from my visit to the great chief dat
has de honor of being my fader? I&#8217;ll catch de
biggest elephant in Afriky as I promised Harv<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
and hang him to de bottom of dis machine so dat
his legs will swing clear and he can see de country
below him. I can make room fur de giraf in dis
seat alongside ob me, and let his head stick frough
de top where he can obsarbe eberyting in front
and back and at de side, and above and below.
Gee! how he&#8217;ll enjoy it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chief Foozleum must be mighty rich. I&#8217;ll
git him to gib me two or free bushels ob diamonds
and sew &#8217;em all ober my clothes and hab a big
one on de end ob each foot.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no end to the extravagant fancies
that roved through the brain of Bohunkus. He
looked at that strange figure in front, always
sitting bolt upright with a hand loosely grasping
a lever on each side, while he stared straight
ahead as if trying to peer beyond the range of
ordinary vision. For long intervals Bunk could
not see the slightest movement of limb or head.
The linen duster was buttoned closely about the
gaunt form and as he sat on the lower end of the
garment the keen wind did not cause any flapping.
By and by there would be a slight twitch of one of
the levers and a change in direction would follow,
though otherwise it would not have been noticeable.
Since the air was calm, a keen breeze was produced
by the progress of the helicopter, which was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
traveling fully a mile a minute. Bunk had donned
his heavy coat before starting and was glad he
did so, for he had to rub his ears to keep them
warm.</p>

<p>As was his custom the aviator flew low, sometimes
approaching within a hundred feet of the
tops of the trees or the tall buildings in the towns
over which he skimmed. Bunk was startled
once or twice by fear of a collision, but the Professor
was not only a marvelous expert, but his
machine responded with quick sensitiveness. At
the slightest move of hand or foot it would turn to
one side, dart upward or dive downward, as he
willed. After a time Bunk&#8217;s misgiving left him
and his confidence in the man became perfect.</p>

<p>The aerial voyage to the southern Adirondacks
was so similar in most respects to what has been
described that we need not dwell upon it. The
Professor did not stop on the way, and when he
reached his workshop the fluid in the tank would
have taken him back without halt to his starting
point. He believed he could keep aloft with
undiminished speed for twenty hours if not longer,
but it would not answer to head eastward over
the Atlantic until able to do better than that. He
had set the limit at two days, for he was wise enough
to give himself a fair margin. It might become<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
necessary to reduce his speed when over mid-ocean,
or some slight disarrangement of his machinery
was possible, though of the latter he felt little fear.</p>

<p>Upon the arrival of the couple at the workshop,
Bunk was pleased to do his first work for his
master. He was told to run the monoplane into
the hangar which stood to one side and slightly to
the rear of the more important structure. He
performed the task so deftly that the Professor
complimented him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see that you may become quite valuable to
me,&#8221; said he in his sepulchral voice, after he had
opened the door of the cabin and peeped in. &#8220;Sit
down on those steps while I have a few words with
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas, sir,&#8221; responded Bunk as he obeyed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much wages do you think you ought to
receive, Bohunkus?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bress yo&#8217; heart, Perfesser, I doan&#8217; want no
wages for what I does for yo&#8217;; ain&#8217;t yo&#8217; gwine to
take me &#8217;cross de Pacific Ocean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not the Pacific,&mdash;the Atlantic.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat&#8217;s what I meant; yo&#8217;s gwine to do a good
deal moah fur me dan I am fur yo&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wish anyone to work for me without
pay; suppose I give you ten dollars a week and
your keep.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>Bunk airily waved his hand and replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;Doan&#8217; make no difference to me; if yo&#8217;s
gwine to feel bad I&#8217;ll take it, but,&#8221; he added with
an inspiring thought, &#8220;it am on two conditions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat when we calls on Chief Foozleum I shall
gib you a pocket full ob diamonds so as to make
it squar&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no objection to that; what is the other
condition?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat yo&#8217; gib me plenty to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the first and only time in his life, Bunk saw
the grizzled whiskers at the side of the Professor&#8217;s
mouth twitch in a way that showed he was smiling.
It was only for an instant, however, when he was
as grave as before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your terms are reasonable. I had forgotten
about it&#8217;s being meal time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Bunk with a sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may have noticed that we have landed
not far from a town; it&#8217;s name is Dawson; I am
acquainted with the landlord and will go there
for supper. I shall bring back a good meal for
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t yo&#8217; gwine to take me along?&#8221; asked the
surprised Bunk; &#8220;I can carry de food a good deal
better inside ob me dan yo&#8217; can outside ob yo&#8217;self.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>&#8220;I prefer that it should not be known for the
present that you are with me; I&#8217;ll walk to the
hotel and I promise you not to keep you waiting
long.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few minutes later the Professor took his
departure and did as he had agreed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX.<br />


IN THE WORKSHOP.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THAT night the Professor forgot the existence
of Bohunkus Johnson and indeed of everything
in the world except the absorbing task
before him. He threw his workshop into one dazzling,
overwhelming blaze and began labor at once.
The structure of his machine was perfected: all
that remained was to force nature to yield her
secret by which the fuel of the aeroplane could be
held effective for two days of twenty-four hours
each. He was sure he was on the verge of the
marvelous discovery.</p>

<p>Before delving into his fascinating work he
instructed Bunk as to how he should dispose of
himself. The boy had eaten a bountiful meal
and though the hour was early was drowsy.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can hear the ripple of the small stream
at the rear of the hangar; there you can drink or
bathe night or morning; here are your sleeping
quarters.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pointed to the rear of the shop where lay a
plank covered with a single blanket. It was the
custom of the Professor to stretch himself upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
this when he felt the need of rest, which it may be
said was infrequently. He did not expect to
sleep on this night, but if compelled to do so, would
snatch brief repose by half reclining in a rustic
chair which stood back of the door at the front.
By and by, Bunk&#8217;s head began to nod, and bidding
the Professor good night he made his way
uncertainly to his couch. Just then the man&#8217;s
foot was on the treadle and he was pressing some
kind of instrument against the whizzing face of
a tiny stone wheel. He made no response to the
salutation of his assistant and probably did not
hear him.</p>

<p>Bunk lay on his side so as to watch the aviator
at his work. He saw him flit from one side of the
shop to the other and mix several kinds of liquid,
one of which gave out so pungent an odor that
the youth sneezed, but without attracting the
attention of the experimenter. Then followed a
series of vivid flashes in which all the colors of
the spectrum blinded the awed spectator. The
man filed, cut, scraped, compounded, and did no
end of things until Bunk grew weary and glided
into dreamland.</p>

<p>He must have slept well beyond midnight, when
apparently without cause he awoke. For a few
minutes he was too confused to locate himself.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
Gradually his recollection came back, and he
realized that he was in blank darkness. His
immediate surroundings were so still that he
heard the soft ripple of the brook near the hangar.</p>

<p>&#8220;I &#8217;spose de Perfesser hab retired,&#8221; concluded
Bunk, &#8220;and I shan&#8217;t see anything ob him till
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was so easy, as a rule, for the colored youth to
sleep at all times that he could not understand why
he not only awoke from sound slumber but could
not woo it back. The longer he lay the wider
awake he became. Finally he sat up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dis am mighty qu&#8217;ar,&#8221; he muttered; &#8220;it looks
as if morning hab come afore de night am frough;
I wonder if tings doan&#8217; got mixed dat way sometimes
in dis part ob de world.&#8221;</p>

<p>The question was beyond his solving. His next
feeling was of curiosity as to the whereabouts of
the Professor. When Bunk last saw him he was
working in the vividly lighted shop. By and by
the lad made out a faint illumination through the
windows that was caused by the partially obscured
moonlight. The door was shut, since nothing
of the kind showed in that direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet dat he&#8217;s goned off,&#8221; was Bunk&#8217;s decision;
&#8220;I wonder if he means to gib me de slip and
sail to Afriky without me. I&#8217;ll find out.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>He recalled the interior of the building well
enough to remember that a wide passage led from
his couch to the opening at the front. The workbenches
were along the sides, so as to give the
inventor elbowroom. Bunk began groping his
way with hands extended to avoid falling over
any obstacle that might have been placed there
while he was asleep. His wakefulness was probably
due to the effect of the fumes of chemicals,
for he had noted them the moment he roused from
slumber.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go outside and if I doan&#8217; see de Perfesser
I&#8217;ll yell for him&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Bunk did not wait until he got outside before
yelling. At that moment, one of his extended
hands came in contact with a live, or rather partly
live wire, and with a wild shout he bounded several
feet in air, tumbled over on his back, kicked and
rolled in an agony more of mind than of body.
In the same instant, the interior of the building
was illuminated as if from the burst of a hundred
suns. As his bewildered senses straggled back he
rose to a sitting posture and saw the towering form
of Professor Morgan looking down upon him with
the most terrible expression he had ever witnessed
on his countenance. Like the youth, he had not
removed his garments and the long duster still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
wrapped his towering figure. The eyes glowed
with piercing intensity and Bunk even fancied
that the long grizzled beard was in flames.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter with you?&#8221; sternly demanded
the crank, in the voice which sounded
like the rolling of thunder.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;m killed,&#8221; replied the bewildered
Bunk, slowly climbing to his feet, &#8220;or mebbe it
were a mule dat kicked me. Hab yo&#8217; got a mule
round here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fool!&#8221; exclaimed the Professor angrily,
&#8220;didn&#8217;t you know better than to go groping round
the shop in the darkness? It is a miracle that you
were not killed by a thousand volts; why didn&#8217;t you
call me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see yo&#8217; nowhere &#8217;bout; &#8217;scuse me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you had called I should have heard you.
I was asleep like yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t hear yo&#8217; breeving; I say, Perfesser,&#8221;
added Bunk with more boldness than he had yet
dared to show, &#8220;ain&#8217;t yo&#8217; keerless in leaving dem
blue blazes layin&#8217; &#8217;round where dey am likely to
swipe a feller in de face when he ain&#8217;t doing
nuffin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You surely will be killed if you go nosing round
the shop when I&#8217;m not with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yo&#8217; war wid me but I didn&#8217;t know it. I say,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
Perfesser, wouldn&#8217;t yo&#8217; as lieb move to some oder
place?&#8221;</p>

<p>The inventor in front of the trembling Bunk
still looked keenly at him, as if a new thought had
flashed into his brain. He spoke with more kindness
than he had shown since they had been together:</p>

<p>&#8220;Bohunkus, I&#8217;m satisfied that this isn&#8217;t the place
for you, though I shall have to stay myself until
we are ready to start. To-morrow I shall take you
to new quarters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat am de best news I&#8217;ve heerd in sebenteen
years; dere&#8217;s only one thing dat would soot me
better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To hear yo&#8217; say dat we&#8217;s gwine to start to
Afriky.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be patient for a day or two. Now, wouldn&#8217;t
you like to go back to your home at Mootsport and
stay there?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bunk did not suspect this was a test question
and was honest in his answer:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sah; not till we&#8217;ve been to Afriky and
spent a few weeks wid Chief Foozleum.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t leave me if I gave you the
chance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not fur de world; do yo&#8217; think I wanter to go<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
home and hear Harv and Dick Hamilton and dere
folks laugh at me? Not much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose they come after you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat&#8217;s nuffin; I&#8217;m my own boss; dey wouldn&#8217;t
git me by a jugful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall see that they don&#8217;t while I am present,&#8221;
said the Professor with a glint of his fiery eyes;
&#8220;I&#8217;ll attend to that, but I shall have to leave you
alone at times and they may come when I am
beyond call.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As I obsarbed dat wouldn&#8217;t make no diff&#8217;rence,
&#8217;cause dey doan&#8217; hab nuffin to do wid me. It
mought be anoder thing if Mr. Hartley lit on me
wid a cartwhip, but he&#8217;ll neber come way up here fur
me, &#8217;cause he doan&#8217; know I&#8217;m here,&mdash;likewise Harv
and his folks doan&#8217; know nuffin &#8217;bout it neither.
No matter where yo&#8217; stow me away Perfesser,
I&#8217;ll stay dere till yo&#8217; am ready to come fur me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man looked at Bunk with a prolonged,
penetrating stare that chilled him through. Then
in his cavernous voice he slowly said:</p>

<p>&#8220;When-you-disobey-me, you-will-die!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas, sir;&#8221; whispered the terrified youth.</p>

<p>The Professor stepped to the bench at his side,
reached up and took a bottle of colorless liquid from
a shelf. Withdrawing the glass stopper he handed
it to the lad:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>&#8220;Smell of that!&#8221; he commanded in the same
awful tones.</p>

<p>Bunk&#8217;s hand trembled so much that he came
near dropping it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t blow me up?&#8221; he asked timidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t hurt you! Do what you are told!&#8221;</p>

<p>The lad dared not hesitate. He held the compound
to his nostrils and took several deep inhalations.
It was a powerful soporific and in a minute
or so he showed its effects. The Professor watched
him, and at the proper moment took the bottle from
his limp grasp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now go back and sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas, sir,&#8221; replied Bunk, who staggered to his
couch, tumbled upon it and almost immediately
sank into a heavy, dreamless slumber. It must
have lasted a long time, for when he awoke the
morning sun was shining through the open door.
The Professor was not in the room, and after
recalling his confused senses, Bunk rose from his
bed. He was slightly dizzy from the effects of the
drug and waited until he could steady himself
before picking his way along the passage to the
outside. He expected to see the aviator, but he
was not in sight and a glance at the hangar showed
it was empty. Professor Morgan and his helicopter
were gone. Bunk was alarmed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>&#8220;I wonder if he&#8217;s started for Afriky and furgot
me! If he has he&#8217;s played a low down trick.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reflection removed this fear and he decided
that his friend or enemy, as the case might be,
had only gone to the village for his morning meal.
Against that theory was the fact that he had taken
his machine with him, or more properly the machine
had taken him. With the distance so short,
it was not reasonable that he would bother to
make the trip by aerial sea.</p>

<p>Bunk sat down outdoors and tried to decide
upon the best thing to do. Suddenly the thought
came to him that it would not only help to pass
away the dismal minutes of waiting, but would be
the proper thing to write a letter to Mootsport.
He entered the building again, stepping very
gingerly, for he had a mortal terror of the wires
and contraptions that were all around him. At
the farther end of the room was a small desk, with
paper, envelopes and pencils, but no ink. First
peeping out of the door to make sure the Professor
was not near, Bunk sat down on the bench provided
and with pencil wrote a letter to Harvey.
He paused with every labored word and listened.
He knew he would detect the returning aviator in
time to play the part of innocence. We remember
the substance of that missive, which was the means<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
of giving Harvey Hamilton his first tangible clue
to the whereabouts of his colored friend.</p>

<p>The letter being finished, the problem of mailing
it remained. It required a stamp and must be
carried to the post office. Now there were fully
a dozen stamps lying on a corner of the desk, but
it was to Bunk&#8217;s credit that he did not use one of
them. Those little red rectangles were each worth
two cents, while the value of the paper and envelope
was so vague as to amount to nothing. It would be
dishonest to appropriate a postage stamp, but not
dishonest to use the other material. Bunk was
always supplied with a moderate amount of funds
and it occurred to him that it would be right to take a
stamp provided he left a nickel in its place, thereby
making generous payment for the accommodation.</p>

<p>&#8220;De Perfesser will notice it,&#8221; was the belief
that stayed his hand; &#8220;he told me not to send any
letter home and if he finds out I&#8217;ve done it he&#8217;ll
blow me all to pieces.&#8221;</p>

<p>He thrust the missive into his coat pocket and
once more passed outside of the workshop. The
location of the cabin as we know was in a lonely
spot, and not a person was in sight. The village
of Dawson lay within easy reach and he believed he
could run thither and back before the return of
the Professor. But he hesitated after passing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
down the path to where it met the highway. He
felt that if seen by the aviator he could make the
excuse that he was merely stretching his legs and
had no thought of going farther.</p>

<p>While he stood debating whether to make a dash
for it, good fortune favored him. Around a bend in
the road, and approaching him, strode a man dressed
as a farmer. He carried a rough staff in one hand and
his trousers were tucked in the tops of his boots.
He responded with a nod to Bunk&#8217;s cheery &#8220;Good
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Am yo&#8217; gwine to Dawson?&#8221; asked the African,
though the course of the pedestrian made the
question superfluous.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve started to do, if I don&#8217;t run
off the track or bust my b&#8217;iler,&#8221; was the characteristic
reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will yo&#8217; please mail dis lub letter fur me?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man accepted the envelope and squinted at it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any stamp onto it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bunk handed him a quarter of a dollar.</p>

<p>&#8220;If yo&#8217; will put a stamp on it yo&#8217; may keep de
change.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, sonny, I&#8217;ll act as mail carrier all day
at them rates.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yo&#8217; mustn&#8217;t say nuffin &#8217;bout it to nobody.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man promised and went on his way.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX.<br />


A CHANGE OF QUARTERS.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AFTER administering the drug which sent
Bunk into dreamland Professor Morgan,
having rested only a short time, resumed his
work. He grudged the time he had already wasted
as he viewed it, and toiled with absorbed earnestness
until an exclamation of impatience showed
he had run against a snag. In experimenting with
a score of subtle fluids he discovered that one
important ingredient was exhausted. He must
obtain more before he could go on with his work.
The chemical was quite common and he knew it
was easy to obtain in Albany, which was not much
more than a hundred miles distant as the crow or
aeroplane flies. He could make the trip well
within four hours and decided to do so. Since the
leading drug stores kept open through the night
there was no need of his delaying. He went to
the hangar, ran out his helicopter and left without
awaking Bunk, who he thought was likely to sleep
all the time he was gone.</p>

<p>It was beginning to grow light when the strange
machine was revealed by its flitting searchlight to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
many of the early risers in the capital of the State.
As it gave out no noise, its appearance, absurdly
exaggerated, was heralded throughout the country.
Stories of a strange colossal airship which prowled
through the heavens only in the night time had
been published and some of the yellow journals
had given illustrations of its appearance. This
one was declared at first to be the same mysterious
visitant of the upper regions, but the fact that the
Dragon of the Skies made its descent in the heart
of the city and that the single occupant stepped out
and made a purchase at the most prominent drug
store, robbed the account of its most thrilling
feature.</p>

<p>Professor Morgan did not return at once. He
snubbed those who gathered round with their
numberless questions. Hiring two trustworthy
men to guard his machine he went to an all-night
restaurant and ate an early breakfast which he
meant should serve until night, since it took too
much time to lunch at noon. Then he decided to
do still more in the way of economizing the minutes
by buying supplies for Bunk, who had the faculty
of being hungry morning, noon and night. The
markets were open and he had no trouble in securing
what he wanted. Biscuits, sugar, salt, pepper,
meat, condensed milk; in fact, all that a rugged and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
growing lad could ask for were stowed in a large
basket which was adjusted on the seat near the
tank. They added considerable to the weight of
the aeroplane, but much less than it was accustomed
to carry in the person of Bohunkus Johnson.</p>

<p>The crowd that remained staring at the helicopter
saw an amazing sight when a horizontal
wheel directly beneath began revolving as the
aviator took his seat, and the machine soared aloft
smoothly, gracefully and in a line as truly vertical
as if drawn by a mathematician. Nothing
of the kind had ever been heard of before.</p>

<p>Bunk having despatched his letter through the
kindness of the countryman, hurried back to the
workshop and seated himself on the little bench in
front to await the return of the Professor. He
thus sat until the sun was well up in the sky,
growing hungrier every minute and with his
patience nearing its limit. Removed from the
presence of the terrible man he felt more free to
indulge his meditations.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if he thinks I&#8217;m gwine to sot here till
I starve to death. He doan&#8217; keer &#8217;bout eating
hisself, but I ain&#8217;t built dat way. I&#8217;ll wait a little
while longer and den if he doesn&#8217;t come I&#8217;ll go to
de willage and eat eberyting in de old place. Golly!
if dat ain&#8217;t him now!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>He was right, for in the clear sky to the southward
he saw the well-remembered Dragon of the
Skies, with wings outspread, approaching at its
usual swift pace. In less time than would be
supposed, the aeronaut settled to rest and Bunk
hurried forward to give the aid he could.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me help yo&#8217; out, Perfesser,&#8221; said he,
extending his hand, but the other gave no heed.
Turning, he lifted the big basket from the seat and
placed it on the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave the car where it is,&#8221; he commanded;
&#8220;for we&#8217;ll need it again in a few minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas, sir;&#8221; replied the lad, looking longingly at
the willow receptacle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have brought you enough food to last a
week,&#8221; said the Professor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; muttered Bunk, &#8220;it looks as if dere am
jest &#8217;nough for breakfast, but I&#8217;ll worry &#8217;long if you
say so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Help yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bunk needed no second invitation. The man
passed into the building, leaving him outside. He
slid off the cover of the basket and his eyes sparkled
at sight of the goodly stock of supplies. He did
not pause in his feasting until one-half the contents
had been placed where it would do the most
good. He was drawing the back of his hand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
across his mouth when the Professor came out,
bringing with him the blanket that had served
Bunk while asleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to take you to your new quarters,&#8221;
he explained. &#8220;My gracious!&#8221; he added, glancing
at the wrecked food, &#8220;have you left anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess dere am &#8217;nough for a bite,&#8221; grinned
Bunk.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a wonder that I never saw equalled; let&#8217;s
be off.&#8221;</p>

<p>The blanket and basket were carefully put in
place, Bunk took his seat and the Professor after
glancing over the machine to make sure that all
was right assumed his usual position and set the
uplifter spinning. So perfect was the working
of the machine that there was no evidence of the
increased weight it carried. Straight up in the air
it rose for a hundred feet and then headed to the
northward. As it approached the wild region
to which we have referred several times the aviator
slackened his pace as much as he could while
retaining buoyancy, leaned out and scanned the
ground over which he was sailing. It did not
take him long to decide upon a landing place, and
he descended at the spot which was visited by
Dick Hamilton some days later.</p>

<p>Bunk had also made good use of his eyes. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
noticed the cabin of guide Akers, the beautiful
little lake beyond, the tent on the shore and the
forms near it, to whom he waved his usual salutation,
and closely studied the surroundings when
they sank to the earth again.</p>

<p>As soon as the two felt the earth under their feet,
they began a search which was quickly ended by
the discovery of the cavern which has also been
described.</p>

<p>&#8220;This will do,&#8221; was the comment of the Professor
after scanning it; &#8220;you couldn&#8217;t ask for
anything better.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bunk surveyed the opening with mingled feelings.
It certainly offered secure shelter against a
storm, which was about all that could be said of
it. Wishing to please his master he remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;I allers sleeps wid my winder open at home
and it&#8217;ll be de same here and dis soots me. I
wouldn&#8217;t mind if I had some carpets or rugs and
a peanner, but I can git along very well as
it am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Carry in the basket,&#8221; commanded the master,
leading the way with the blanket over his arm.
He flung it down at the rear of the cavern and Bunk
set the receptacle beside it. Then the two walked
outside, where they stood beside the aeroplane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Before I go,&#8221; said the Professor in his most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
awesome tones, &#8220;I have a few things to say to you
which you must not forget on your peril.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is to be your home till I call to take you
to Africa.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The time will go slowly to you, but here you
must stay!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you grow tired of sleeping and eating
you may walk through the woods, but take care
that you don&#8217;t go so far that you can&#8217;t find your
way back quickly and surely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Confound you!&#8221; exclaimed the Professor
suddenly, &#8220;can&#8217;t you say anything but &#8216;yas, sir&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,-dat is-yas, sir,&#8221; replied the confused
Bunk, startled by the words and manner of the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, why don&#8217;t you say something else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Professor saw that it was useless to protest
and therefore ignored the provoking response.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have important work awaiting me and must
now return to my shop,&#8221; he said in a gentler voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;When will yo&#8217; come back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I intend to call each morning, unless something
unexpected prevents.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>&#8220;Yo&#8217; won&#8217;t forgit to bring some wittles wid
yo&#8217; each time, Perfesser?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall see that your wants in that respect are
met; unless,&#8221; he grimly added, &#8220;the supply in
Dawson gives out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yo&#8217; can reach oder towns if dat tooks place,&#8221;
suggested Bunk, with no suspicion of the sarcasm
of the other remark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bear in mind what I have said: this is to be
your home until we are ready to start across the
ocean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If any strangers come near, you don&#8217;t give
them a word of explanation. Avoid having anything
to do with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that time, Professor Morgan had no knowledge
that Harvey Hamilton was or rather soon
would be on his track. He therefore made no
reference to him, since he did not think it possible
that he would become a factor in the problem.
He stepped into his seat, and without saying anything
further hied away to his workshop. He was
impatient to resume his experimentation now that
he had the lacking chemical.</p>

<p>At last Bohunkus Johnson found himself alone
in the wilds of the southern Adirondacks. He
did not need to be reminded that if he wished company<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
he did not have to travel many miles to find
it. He was within reach of settlements, and
scattered houses and it was no difficult walk to
that tent on the shore of the placid lake. But the
African trip was an obsession with him. His heart
was set on the voyage, of whose perils he never
dreamed. Nothing could quench that longing
except its realization or death itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do jest as de Perfesser says,&#8221; he said to himself;
&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I sent dat letter home, for mebbe
dere was someting in it which will set Harv onto
my track,&mdash;but I can&#8217;t think what it am onless&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He almost dropped to the ground in dismay.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t put any name to de top of de page, but
de postmaster has stamped de word &#8216;Dawson&#8217; on
de enwollop. Jee whizz! I neber thought ob <i>dat</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>You will remember that it was this fact which
told Harvey the one thing he needed to know in
order to make an intelligent search for his friend.
It was too late now to correct the error, and it was
well for Bunk that he did not recall certain other
words in his letter which gave invaluable aid to
his friend. He found great relief in the belief
that the start across the ocean would be made in
a day or two at the furthest.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that Bunk&#8217;s situation in
more than one respect was trying. In the first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
place, he had no firearms, no such thing being
thought necessary when he and Harvey Hamilton
first left home with their biplane. He had not
so much as a fishing line with which to beguile
the hours that could not fail to become wearisome.
He had been promised food and could not doubt
that the Professor would see that he did not suffer
for nourishment.</p>

<p>The first day spent in and about the cavern was
tedious, though a goodly part of it was passed in
eating and sleeping. When darkness at last began
closing in there was nothing left of the supplies
that had been brought in the basket.</p>

<p>&#8220;If de Perfesser forgits me and doan&#8217; come in de
morning,&#8221; reflected Bunk, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be in an orful fix,
but I can always rampage frough de country. I&#8217;ve
got &#8217;nough money to buy a good deal and when
dat runs out I can grab things &#8216;permiscuous.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>His idea of the wild animals that haunt the
Adirondacks was vague. He knew that deer,
bears, and he believed wolves were met with at
times in different parts. Had he passed through
Harvey&#8217;s experience he might have become more
disquieted. He suspected that tigers, leopards,
lions, giraffes and possibly elephants were to be
met with in the wilder portions, but the reliance
upon which he always fell back was the conviction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
that none of these creatures knew how to climb a
tree, while he was master of the art.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish dis cave had a door dat I could shet,
but it doan&#8217; hab nuffin ob de kind and if any ob
dem critters walks into de front I&#8217;m catched for
dere ain&#8217;t any way out ob de back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Investigation had told him that the one yawning
opening was the only means of ingress and
egress, because of which fact he studied a long time
the problem of the safest thing to do. Suddenly
it flashed upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll roost ebery night! Why didn&#8217;t I thunk ob
dat afore?&#8221;</p>

<p>Before darkness fully closed in, he left the
cavern and began a careful tour of the immediate
neighborhood. It did not require long to find a
refuge that seemed to be specially prepared for
him. It was a broad, branching oak, whose trunk
was so huge that, to his disappointment, he saw
no way of climbing it. His predicament was the
reverse of the <i>ursus</i> species, for such a big shaggy
stairs would have been easy for a bear to ascend.
Slowly circling the forest monarch and using his
strong eyes well in the obscurity, he soon fixed upon
the means of making his way into the branches. It
was, in short, to use a smaller tree which grew so
close to the oak that their branches interlocked.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI.<br />


BUNK CAMPS OUT.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BUNK&#8217;S expertness in climbing served him
well. With no trouble he rapidly ascended
the maple, whose trunk was six inches or
more in diameter and whose branches with
their soft, green foliage were interlocked with the
more rugged limbs of the immense oak. The
lowest branch of the latter was ten inches thick,
and put out horizontally at a height of ten feet or
more from the ground. It would have made a
tree of itself.</p>

<p>When the youth found himself among the foliage
he was able to discern in the fast increasing darkness
the main limb. It was so near that, carefully
balancing himself, he swung out and let go of his
own support. The feat was not difficult and he
seized the rugged support, which dipped considerably,
but would have sustained a far greater
weight without breaking. He crept over it to the
massive trunk. It was in the crotch of this that
he meant to make his couch for the night. He
was too high to be in danger from any roving
beasts, unless of the very largest kind.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>&#8220;I &#8217;spose an elephant might git me with his
trunk, but I could hear him tramping the leaves
and could scoot to the top of the tree. De worstest
am a gerauf; they hab such long necks dat dey
can pick de ball off a church steeple, but if I disremembers
right dey doan&#8217; bite, but butt wid dere
horns; dat lets me out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bunk had secured his perch, but the problem
of making it a reposeful bed was a different matter.
At first he tried sitting astride of the limb with his
back against the trunk. This answered for a
time, but soon became as onerous as the seat of
Harvey Hamilton did when he was fleeing from
the bear. Then he lay forward on his face along
the limb, which he still bestrode. That was very
little improvement and he had to give it up.</p>

<p>&#8220;De only way fur a feller to sleep am to lay
down,&#8221; he exclaimed disgustedly, &#8220;and dat&#8217;s what
I&#8217;m gwine to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>He carefully extended his body along the
shaggy support, face downward, steadying himself
by grasping a smaller branch which put out from
the larger. Having done this, Bunk held his place
for a few minutes and then in trying to improve
it rolled off the limb and dropped to the ground.</p>

<p>The distance was so trifling that he suffered no
hurt though his feelings were much disturbed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>&#8220;I oughter fetched my blanket or laid some
boards on de limbs; dat&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll do to-morrer
if I can find de boards.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nothing having been seen or heard to frighten
him, he decided to go back to the cavern and
spend his first night with only the partial protection
he could find there. He had not as yet caught
a glimpse of any wild animals and he did not
believe he had cause to fear his own species. So
he lay down and slept without waking until day
came again.</p>

<p>At the brook which ran near, he bathed his face
and hands, and then climbed to the most elevated
portion of the rocks to await the Professor, who
had promised to bring him breakfast. He was
ravenously hungry, as was to be expected, and to
his delight he was not forced to suffer long. The
helicopter was really ahead of time and the aviator
proved that he appreciated the appetite of
the colored lad, who gave thanks for his thoughtfulness.</p>

<p>The man was alert and seemed to be in high
spirits over the progress he had made. His
manner was so noticeable that Bunk asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s yo&#8217; getting along, Perfesser?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Splendidly,&#8221; was the reply; &#8220;everything is
going right. I have completed my compound<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
by which I can keep the machine going for two
days; all that remains is to tune it up so as to be
sure of making a hundred miles an hour. I shall
do that to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Den we&#8217;ll start for Afriky&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow. I must complete a few experiments
first, but they are trifling and will result
all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat&#8217;s good news,&#8221; remarked the happy Bunk,
catching the contagion; &#8220;yo&#8217;ll find me ready as
soon as yo&#8217; am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you seen anybody while I was away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody hain&#8217;t been near here, but I can look
down ober de lake and see folks afishing and de
tent ober on t&#8217;other side.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If any of them should wander up this way,
don&#8217;t let them see you. You will remember?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must be off, for every minute now counts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Professor resumed his seat, set the uplifter
spinning, slowly rose in the air until at the right
elevation, when he darted southward like a
swallow on the wing. Left to himself, Bunk
began preparing for the tedious hours before him.
He was eager to fit up a sleeping couch in the oak
from which he had fallen the night before. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
would have carried out his plan but for one drawback:
he had no boards to serve him.</p>

<p>A bright idea struck him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make a hammock; all I hab to do am to
nail de corners on to de limbs and sleep jest like
I do in my trundle bed at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fact that not a nail was within reach did
not deter him. Bringing the blanket from the
cavern he slung it over one shoulder, climbed the
sapling and readily picked his way among the
branches of the oak. These were not placed as
he wished, but after a good deal of work, no end
of pains and considerable ingenuity, he managed
to fasten the corners by twisting and tying them
around the limbs until he had a fair imitation of
the ordinary hammock with which we are all
familiar. True, the center dipped lower than he
wished, and when he gingerly trusted his weight
to it the blanket sagged still more. In fact Bunk&#8217;s
position was much as if he were seated in the top of
an open barrel with his head and feet protruding
through the opening.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dere&#8217;s one big adwantage ob dis,&#8221; he reflected;
&#8220;if de thing gibs way when I&#8217;m asleep I&#8217;ll drap
squar, so I&#8217;ll be setting as if I&#8217;m in a chair when I
hit de ground. Ef I gits tired I can flop ober;
I&#8217;ll try it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>With some difficulty he squirmed upon his face,
with his heels almost touching the back of his
head. The sensation was pleasant at first, but
any unnatural position of the body is sure to
become irksome in sleep, and it was to be feared
that the lad would find his plan a failure when put
to the test. He determined to try it, however, and
came down to the ground satisfied with what he
had accomplished.</p>

<p>&#8220;What the deuce are you trying to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bunk leaped off the ground and stared at the
point whence the startling question had come.
A middle-aged man, carrying a Winchester rifle,
which rested in the hollow of his left arm, his
smooth-shaven face expanded into a broad grin,
had evidently been watching his actions for some
minutes. The colored youth was so flustered that
it must be said he did not do justice to himself in
his replies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;why, I hung dat blanket up dere to
dry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that it is wet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, it will be when it rains and I wanter hab
it ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From the way you acted it looks as if you&#8217;re
trying to fix up a hammock among them limbs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dats it!&mdash;dats it! I done forgot de name.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; demanded the man, looking
sharply at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bohunkus Johnson, sah.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A blamed queer name; what brought you
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bunk was on the point of telling the truth,
when he reflected that it might reveal more than
Professor Morgan wished.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m hunting deers,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you killed any?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sartinly; I&#8217;ve killed &#8217;leben.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Laying round in de woods; haben&#8217;t yo&#8217; seed
any ob &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s your gun?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man was firing his questions so fast that
the bewildered Bunk floundered into deep water
before he could check himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I frowed it away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you do that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had a fout wid de last buck and broke de
lock ober his head; yo&#8217; see it warn&#8217;t no use, so I
frowed it ober de rocks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure you killed eleven deer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mought hab been two or free more, but dere
war dat many sartin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m a game warden and will take you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
along with me; I&#8217;m looking for just such scamps
as you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bunk&#8217;s jaw dropped and his knees shook.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&mdash;what yo&#8217; gwine to do wid me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a thousand dollars fine for shooting a deer
out of the season; twenty years in prison for killing
two, and hanging by the heels till you&#8217;re dead for
scalping eleven.&#8221;</p>

<p>The terrified Bunk collapsed. What a forceful
illustration of the wisdom of telling the truth at all
times! He had long been known at home as one
who hated a falsehood, and now when he strayed
momentarily from the right path the penalty was
awful. He broke into a cackling laugh and in a
tremulous voice said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I war joking, mister; I hain&#8217;t killed no
deers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never thought you had; the next time you
try to spin an outlandish yarn don&#8217;t make quite so
big a fool of yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>With which Jim Haley, who later met Dick
Hamilton, turned on his heel and walked away.</p>

<p>Bunk scratched his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Blamed if I doan&#8217; begin to think Deacon Buggs
am right; he allers said at prayer meeting dat dere
ain&#8217;t no sense in sticking to a lie when yo&#8217;re
cotched in it. Dat feller talked so fast dat I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
couldn&#8217;t git time to fix up my story. Next time
I&#8217;ll straighten out tings better.&#8221;</p>

<p>With so many hours at command, the youth did
more wandering through the surrounding solitude
than before. He took particular care not to meet
any persons because of a well founded fear that he
could not withstand the fire of questions that
would be leveled at him. Professor Morgan had
assured him that the grand start would be made
on the morrow, and Bunk must use every precaution
against doing the least thing that would
interfere with the plan. It was this dread which
caused him suddenly to turn off when he found he
was approaching the smoke of a camp fire which
some party had kindled among the trees. He stole
away until assured he was beyond danger of being
seen by any of the strangers, whose friendship or
lack of enmity toward him he could not doubt.</p>

<p>After a time Bunk turned his steps toward the
lake, still resolute of purpose to keep clear of all
persons, but he yielded to his curiosity regarding
a canoe which was anchored near the northern end
and not far from shore. In it were seated three
men engaged in fishing. In the stillness he could
hear them when they spoke, though he did not
catch the words uttered. The trees, undergrowth
and rocks gave him all the screen he could need in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
approaching the little party. When he had gone
as far as was prudent, he stopped, still carefully
concealing himself.</p>

<p>Suddenly one of them laughed. Something
familiar in the sound startled the lad, who, shading
his eyes with one hand, peered intently at the
group. A moment later he gasped:</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee! dat am Dick Hamilton!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he recalled what he had heard before
leaving home about Harvey&#8217;s brother being on
a vacation in the Adirondacks. Without suspecting
it, Bunk had been brought to the neighborhood
of his camp, which must be at the tent he
had several times noticed. With this recollection
the shiver of fear quickly passed. His first thought
was that Dick had come thither to take him home
and that one of his companions was Harvey. A
scrutiny, however, showed that the other two were
strangers. Then he was comforted by the reflection
that it was impossible for Harvey to know
where he was.</p>

<p>This discovery convinced Bunk that he was
running too great risk in venturing so close to the
lake. If Dick Hamilton should see him he would
call him to account and take measures to head off
that trip to Africa. Accordingly, he stealthily
withdrew and when beyond all danger of being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
observed he hurried to his quarters up the mountainous
slope.</p>

<p>The question he asked himself was whether he
should tell Professor Morgan what he had learned.
He decided there was no need to do so. From his
elevated station he kept an eye upon the canoe in
the lake. He saw at the end of two or more hours
that the party were through fishing for the time.
One of them began swinging the paddle, and the
canoe glided southward and turned into the small
inlet at the back of the camp, where it was drawn
up the shingle and the trio walked to the tent.
Although the distance did not prevent Bunk from
seeing the figures, and he was sure he could distinguish
Dick Hamilton, he was unable to note
their features, and but for the close view he had
obtained he would not have suspected the identity
of his friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dick am more rambunctious dan Harv,&#8221;
reflected Bunk, &#8220;and it won&#8217;t do fur him to know
I&#8217;m in dis part ob de world. When I come back
from Afriky I&#8217;ll tell him de whole story and he&#8217;ll
laugh as much as me.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII.<br />


FACE TO FACE AT LAST.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SO far as sleeping in a hammock suspended a
dozen feet above ground was concerned,
Bunk&#8217;s attempt was as much a failure as his
effort to rest among the limbs of the oak on the
previous night. In disgust he gave it up, and
yanking the blanket free went back to the cavern
and again slept without disturbance. The weather
continued so mild that the covering gave him all
the protection he needed.</p>

<p>When Professor Morgan made his appearance
in the morning, not quite as early as before,
Bunk saw he was not in such buoyant spirits
as on his last call. Something had gone wrong.
He made no replies to the lad&#8217;s questions, but
when about to leave him for the day, explained:</p>

<p>&#8220;Things haven&#8217;t come out as I anticipated; I
shall have to go to Albany again to get a new
chemical; the last was not pure; do you understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t understand a word I said to you,&#8221;
snorted the man; &#8220;why do you pretend you do?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>&#8220;Yas, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>With an angry grunt the aviator mounted his
seat, started the uplifter revolving and sailed
away without another word.</p>

<p>Several days now passed so similar in all respects
that it is not worth while to dwell upon them. The
Professor remained glum and sour and Bunk held
him in too great awe to repeat any questions after
his first curt snubbing. He made his sleeping
quarters in the cavern, ate and wandered through
the neighborhood, watching people at a distance
and always keeping out of their sight. Had he
possessed a field glass like Harvey Hamilton, he
would have made some discoveries that would
have interested and alarmed him.</p>

<p>We come now to the day of the disastrous search
made by the Hamilton brothers. Bunk was
sitting at the mouth of the cavern and beginning
to feel drowsy when his nerves were set tingling
by the whistled signal of the young man, who
had almost come upon him. Had Dick refrained
from giving that warning he would have been
face to face with Bunk within the following five
minutes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat&#8217;s him!&#8221; gasped the negro, scooting behind
the cavern and among the undergrowth, where
he crouched low.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>He not only heard every signal, but caught a
glimpse of the young man. Had it been Harvey
whom he saw he probably would have gone forward
in response to the calls, but he dared not
let the elder brother see him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d doot,&#8221; muttered Bunk, whose conscience
reproved him, &#8220;if I could be sure he wouldn&#8217;t
butt in and make trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>One fact lifted the spirits of Bunk to the highest
notch. That morning Professor Morgan exultingly
told him that he had attained complete
success at last. The new chemical had done its
work perfectly; the last obstacle had been overcome,
and the start for distant Africa would be
made the next day without fail. It was this
announcement which caused the youth to guard
against discovery by his friend. Of course he
did not dream that Harvey Hamilton was in the
vicinity.</p>

<p>Bunk was in such a fluster over the knowledge
that his dismal days in this mountain retreat were
ended that he slept little. This was his last night
in the cave and the wonderful voyage was to begin
on the morrow.</p>

<p>Upon what trivial incidents do the most important
events often turn! Professor Morgan told
the truth when he asserted that he had reached the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
end of his experimentation. He had solved the
magical combination of chemical agents by which
the supply of fuel for his helicopter would serve for
more than two days without renewal. Having
done this, all that remained was to finish his
preparations for leaving the continent and voyaging
over the Atlantic. His machine worked so
superbly that he had no fear of any storm he
might encounter, though he wisely decided to
study weather probabilities before making his
venture. Repeated tests convinced him that an
average speed of eighty miles was easy to maintain.
This would require a trifle less than thirty-three
hours to go from Quebec to Liverpool, his intention
from the first being to start from the former city.</p>

<p>The change he made in his programme was this:
instead of leaving Quebec, he would make his
starting point on the New Jersey coast, not far
below Sandy Hook, with his destination the island
of St. Vincent, of the Cape Verde group, off the
coast of Africa. This route is three hundred miles
longer than the other, but as he viewed it the fact
was not worth considering because of the new
fuel he had invented. It was not far from St.
Vincent to the African coast, and he preferred not
to land in England because of the excitement his
feat would cause.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>So long as his purpose was to depart from Quebec,
he intended to lay in the necessary stock of
provisions in that city, deferring the work until
the last moment. But this was sure to bring unpleasant
notoriety, and he now saw an easy escape
from it. No large amount of supplies would be
needed and he could procure them at the Washington
Hotel in Dawson. As for himself, he did not
mind fasting for a couple of days, but he knew how
it was with his assistant. He therefore proceeded
to stock up in the little country town, because of
which his usual morning call upon Bohunkus
Johnson was delayed, and it was that same delay
which gave the necessary time for the happening
of more than one important event.</p>

<p>Had Bunk not been impatient over the tardiness
in the return of Professor Morgan, he would have
paid attention to the two persons in the canoe
at the end of the lake. He would have seen them
leave the craft and disappear among the trees
and undergrowth that lined the sheet of water,
but he noted nothing of the kind. It is doubtful
which emotion was the stronger within him,&mdash;the
desire for satisfying his craving for food, or his
eagerness to start upon the aerial voyage to the
Dark Continent. He took his station in front of
the cavern and scanned the heavens to the south,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
wondering what could keep the aviator away so
long.</p>

<p>&#8220;He oughter hurry up, &#8217;cause it am a long way
and we&#8217;ve waited so many days dat dere ain&#8217;t no
sense ob waiting longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hark! What was that which fell upon his ear?
It sounded like the whistle which he had heard
so many times when he and Harvey or Dick Hamilton
were calling to each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t be Harv,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;&#8217;cause he am
ten thousand miles away; must be dat Dick is
poking round here agin.&#8221;</p>

<p>This time there was no mistake. The signal
was so clear and sharp that Bunk turned sharply
and stared at the point whence it came. He was
struck speechless when he saw the smiling Harvey
walk toward him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Bunk! I&#8217;m glad to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>For one moment the lad stood transfixed, and
then overwhelmed by the threatened calamity, as
it seemed to him, he wheeled and made a dash for
the other side of the open space, where was the
pile of rocks that had served him as headquarters
for a number of days. He had almost reached
them when to his consternation Dick Hamilton
stepped forth and confronted him. Escape was
shut off.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>&#8220;Well, my blooming idiot, what have you to
say for yourself? I have a great mind to kick you
all the way from here to Mootsport. This is a
pretty chase you have given us; you aren&#8217;t worth
half the trouble you have caused.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bunk gaped, but did not attempt reply. Suddenly
he turned to run in the opposite direction,
but Harvey had drawn nigh and was within arm&#8217;s
reach.</p>

<p>&#8220;Try it if you want to,&#8221; said Dick, pretending
to raise his Winchester; &#8220;I should like to prove
how quick I can drop you.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the first time the lad found his tongue,
though both listeners noted the quaver in his voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;What yo&#8217; want to shoot me fur, Dick? I
hain&#8217;t done nuffin to yo&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harvey was softer hearted than his brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are not going to hurt you, Bunk, but you
deserve to have the worst trouncing you ever
received in your life. It seems to me you have
been a long time getting started for Africa.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m expecting de Perfesser, Harv, ebery
minute; dis am de morning dat we am to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Dick, as he came still nearer,
&#8220;that little trip is indefinitely postponed.&#8221;</p>

<p>This declaration roused Bunk. He knew the
brothers would interfere with him if they gained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
the chance, and now they were doing so, for of a
surety the two were in accord.</p>

<p>&#8220;See yere, Dick, yo&#8217; hain&#8217;t got nuffin to do wid
dis; you ain&#8217;t my boss.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you want me to prove that I am; here,
Harv, hold my gun for a minute while I show
Bunk that I&#8217;m his boss.&#8221;</p>

<p>The words of revolt had roused the temper of
the younger, who accepted the weapon from Dick&#8217;s
hand, quite content that he should chastise the
ungrateful lad.</p>

<p>But the dusky youth had no liking for a struggle
of that nature. It would have been fun for the
young athlete, figuratively speaking, to wipe the
ground with him. Dick had demonstrated his
ability in that direction more than once. He
doubled his fists and stepped in front of Bunk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put up your hands and we&#8217;ll settle the question
in the next three minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I doan&#8217; want nuffin to do wid yo&#8217;,&#8221; growled
the negro, edging to one side; &#8220;but I&#8217;d like to know
if I hain&#8217;t de right to do as I blamed please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; for you haven&#8217;t the sense of a one-eyed
owl with the pip. Why didn&#8217;t you ask permission
of Mr. Hartley to go on this tomfool trip?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t hab de chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you wrote that letter to Harv and told<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
him you were in this part of the country, you
could have asked Mr. Hartley&#8217;s consent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s dat?&#8221; demanded Bunk; &#8220;I didn&#8217;t tell
yo&#8217; nuffin; what yo&#8217; talkin&#8217; &#8217;bout?&#8221;</p>

<p>Harvey interposed just then and showed the thick-witted
lad how his second letter gave the clue they
needed, as proof of which the young man was here
on the ground, with his aeroplane but a few miles
away. When the absurd truth penetrated Bunk&#8217;s
head his self-disgust was amusing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee! I neber thunk ob dat; warn&#8217;t I a big
fool?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have never been anything else,&#8221; replied
Dick; &#8220;when you get back home I shall advise
Mr. Hartley to tie a rope round your leg and fasten
the other end to a fence post; you are not fit to be
trusted alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bunk did not resent these disrespectful allusions,
but it galled him sorely to see his life ambition
snatched from him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I doan&#8217; see why yo&#8217; try to stop me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not trying, Bohunkus,&mdash;we&#8217;re <i>doing</i> it,&#8221;
replied Dick with a meaning grin; &#8220;if you have
any doubt remaining I shall be glad to remove it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bunk was in a torturing dilemma. He saw the
one enrapturing dream of his life, just on the
verge of fulfillment, about to be dissipated like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
a wreath of vapor. If Professor Morgan had kept
his promise and come to this meeting place at the
usual hour, they would now be on their way to
the &#8220;land of hope.&#8221; And, as we know, he would
have arrived on time but for his change of plan
which led him to stock up at the little hotel in
Dawson instead of doing so at another stage of the
trip.</p>

<p>On the other hand a lion stood in the path in
the person of Dick Hamilton, who left no doubt
of his purpose of checking the mad scheme before
the first real step could be taken. Bunk was well
enough acquainted with the young man to know
he was in earnest and would carry out every threat
he had made. The lad began to wheedle. In a
whimpering voice he asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s de use ob treating me dis way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What way?&#8221; demanded the implacable Dick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stopping my going to Afriky; I neber done
nuffin to yo&#8217;, so why do yo&#8217; use me so blamed
mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dick was fast losing patience, but Harvey felt
sympathy for the misguided lad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bunk, do you know that Professor Morgan is
crazy?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>The negro started as if stung.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yo&#8217; doan&#8217; mean dat, Harv!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>&#8220;I surely do; he is as crazy as a June bug and
has been for a long time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Plainly Bunk was impressed. He stared at his
friend and then administered a sharp reproof by
asking:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t yo&#8217; tell me dat afore?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ought to have done so, and am sorry I didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you hadn&#8217;t been the champion idiot you
would have found it out in five minutes for yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Dick who said this.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knowed he acted mighty qu&#8217;ar sometimes
and said cur&#8217;ous tings dat I didn&#8217;t understand,
but I neber thought he was out of his head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes he has as much sense as you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Umph! if he doesn&#8217;t have a hundred times as
much,&#8221; interrupted Dick, &#8220;he&#8217;s not only crazy but
the biggest fool in Christendom. Now I suppose
you are ready to turn your back on him and go
home with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dunno &#8217;bout dat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, here comes the Professor, Dick, and you
must settle with him,&#8221; said Harvey.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII.<br />


MILO MORGAN&#8217;S WATERLOO.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE three caught sight of the helicopter in the
same instant. The strange machine was
rushing through the air like a colossal eagle.
Professor Morgan had seen the group while some
distance away and headed for it, sailing at a height
of less than two hundred feet and rapidly descending.
Instead of approaching in a direct line, he
made a sweeping circle and came down in the ordinary
way by volplaning instead of making use of
his uplifter.</p>

<p>While these man&#339;uvres were going on Dick
Hamilton stepped across to his brother and reached
out his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me have the rifle, Harv; it looks as if we&#8217;re
going to have lively times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; gasped the terrified Bunk; &#8220;yo&#8217; ain&#8217;t
gwine to shoot him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That depends; if you try any tantrums I may
have to plug you first. Understand, Bunk, that
you are to stand back and not open your mouth or
do a thing till I give you permission.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas, sir.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>Harvey would have made protest, for he was
filled with shuddering dread, but he realized that
for the present he stood in the same situation as
Bunk. The big brother had stepped to the front
and taken charge of affairs. Moreover, he never
forgot the truth that in dealing with an insane
person you must first impress him with the fact
that you do not hold him in the slightest fear.
While as a rule it is not wise to dispute or argue
or try to turn him aside from his purpose by force,
occasions may arise like the present when no other
course is possible.</p>

<p>Professor Morgan must have read the meaning
of the sight that brought him to the spot. He
recognized Harvey before he stepped out of his
machine and his rage flamed up against him.
Ignoring the other two, he strode toward the young
aviator with clenched fists and with murder in his
blazing eyes. In a thunderous bass he demanded:</p>

<p>&#8220;What business have you here? I&#8217;ll teach
you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He had said this much and his long legs were
still in motion, when Dick leaped between them
and holding his rifle at his hip with muzzle leveled
at the infuriated man, he commanded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop! if you touch him I&#8217;ll let daylight through
you!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>The Professor halted and turned upon the other,
his frame trembling with surcharged fury.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll kill you!&#8221;</p>

<p>It is impossible to picture the frightful scene at
this moment. Bunk Johnson was silent and
awed. Harvey was a little to one side and in front
of him, while in the other direction stood Dick, one
foot advanced as if ready to bound forward, his
right hand inclosing the lock of his gun, so that
the forefinger could be seen crooked around the
trigger. The weapon was so pointed that only a
slight pressure was needed to send a bullet through
the long gaunt body hardly a dozen feet away.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; calmly replied Dick; &#8220;you can
begin as soon as you please, my distinguished
friend, but before you reach me you will have to
stop ten spheres of lead and by that time I calculate
I shall be able to handle you without the need
of my Winchester.&#8221;</p>

<p>Professor Morgan may have been &#8220;off his base,&#8221;
but he could not fail to read the meaning of those
words, backed up by the pose of him who uttered
them. He stopped like a tiger baffled of his prey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you shoot?&#8221; he hissed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t given me the excuse I&#8217;m waiting
for; in the case of every one of the seven men I
have shot my explanation secured my acquittal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
in the courts. I&#8217;m taking the same course with
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sight of Harvey seemed to concentrate once
more the lunatic&#8217;s resentment against him. But for
the presence of that Winchester and the man behind
the gun, he would have rended the youth, provided
the latter did not stand him off with his Colt.</p>

<p>&#8220;What business, I demand, have you to come
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please address your remarks to me,&#8221; said
Dick; &#8220;I&#8217;m boss of this job and that brother
of mine over there hasn&#8217;t a word to say. He
came up here, I may tell you, to take Bohunkus
Johnson home with him, and he&#8217;s going to do it
as sure as two and two make four. If you have
any views to express on the situation do so now
or forever after hold your peace.&#8221;</p>

<p>Checked thus the Professor turned toward the
paralyzed Bunk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you wish to go with me to Africa?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have these people any right to stop you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; exclaimed the Professor, with the first
oath that his two listeners had ever heard him
utter, &#8220;have done with that damnable &#8216;Yas, sir!&#8217;
I&#8217;m tired of hearing it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>&#8220;Yas, sir,&#8221; replied Bunk, who must not be
blamed, for really he hardly knew whether he was
standing on his head or feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have brought food to last our trip and everything
is ready. Go to your seat in the machine
and we will start at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas, sir,&#8221; responded the negro lad, taking a
step in the direction of the monoplane, only to find
that Dick Hamilton was as alert as before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Back with you! If you want to save what little
brains you have don&#8217;t take another step in that
direction.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Bunk halted and stared in wretched perplexity
at the young man. Could Professor
Morgan at that moment have caught his eye, he
would have controlled him absolutely through that
mysterious hypnotic power with which nature had
endowed him. But it was Dick who now held him
enchained.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bunk, start for the lake and start a-running.
When you get there, wait for us. GO!&#8221;</p>

<p>The lad broke into a headlong dash, shouting at
the top of his voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Murder! fire! robbers! thieves! sabe me!&#8221;</p>

<p>And he kept it up until he crashed out of sight
of the three who remained behind. By a tremendous
effort, Dick Hamilton maintained his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
sternness of expression. As for Harvey, he did not
try to restrain his silent laughter. It was the most
comical incident he had seen in many a day.
Professor Morgan glared and was mute. He
seemed utterly at a loss and unable to grasp the
situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Professor,&#8221; said Dick addressing him,
&#8220;don&#8217;t you think it is about time you ended this
call? We are growing a little weary of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you my master?&#8221; asked the lunatic in his
sepulchral voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks that way just now; if you have any
doubt let&#8217;s test it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harvey wished to ask one or two questions, but
thought it would be unwise. It was clear that the
Professor hated him unspeakably for the overthrow
of his plans. No doubt, as has been said,
he would have leaped upon the youth but for that
other young man who held a deadly Winchester
in his grasp. It should not be thought that Harvey
felt any personal fear. He had his revolver
at command and would have used it if necessary
to save his own life, but he dreaded any such an
issue unspeakably.</p>

<p>&#8220;Professor,&#8221; said Dick in the even tone he had
used from the first, &#8220;why don&#8217;t you start for
Africa? You won&#8217;t have Bunk for a companion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
and you are gaining nothing by this delay. How
long do you think you will be on the road?&#8221;</p>

<p>Harvey could not prevent himself from saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope the Professor won&#8217;t try it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s easy to prevent him, if you wish it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which is the most vulnerable part of his helicopter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not sure; why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It strikes me that the tank will answer best
for a target; I can put a bullet through that and let
out all that wonderful fluid which is to furnish his
motive power. I rather think the Professor will
have to make a little longer delay, and in the meantime
we can see that he is placed in an asylum,
where he belongs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use of this dilly-dallying?&#8221; suddenly
broke out Dick Hamilton, whose patience was
ended. &#8220;Professor, if you don&#8217;t board that machine
and go back to your workshop at Purvis,
I&#8217;ll bore a hole through it and then perforate you
similarly. Step lively! Get a move on you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not through with you!&#8221; warned the aviator,
still quivering with rage; &#8220;I go, but I return and
will make you rue this hour!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By-by; I shall be ready for you whether you
call by day or at night.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>With two bounds the lunatic reached his machine,
sprang into his seat, jerked the lever which
controlled the uplifter, and began rising from the
earth. As soon as he was clear of his surroundings,
he sailed away at terrific speed, and it was noticeable
that he headed south, which was in the direction
of his Purvis workshop.</p>

A NEW RISK.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;WOULD I have shot Professor Morgan?&#8221;
repeated Dick Hamilton in recalling
the incidents just related to his friends
in camp. &#8220;Not for the world. I should no more
have fired at that poor fellow than I should have
slain&mdash;well, say that buck with the big antlers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you made frightful threats against him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All pure bluff; I didn&#8217;t mean a word of it; you
know that the first step to secure mastery of a
lunatic is to make him afraid of you. I found it
rather hard work in the Professor&#8217;s case, but think
I succeeded.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What would you have done if he had attacked
me, as he started to do?&#8221; asked Harvey.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew you had your Colt and that each
chamber was loaded, but before you could have
drawn and fired, I should have thrown away my
rifle and leaped upon him. His build and looks
show he is a lithe, wiry fellow, but I should have
mastered him. It might have been a hard struggle
and some ugly blows would have been struck and
they would have been a cause of keen regret, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
you can&#8217;t feel enmity against an irresponsible
person. But by keeping up the bluff I headed
him off.&#8221;</p>

<p>This brief extract from the conversation of the
group at the tent by the lake was closed by the
following curious remark of the elder Hamilton:</p>

<p>&#8220;If it hadn&#8217;t all turned out as it did, I never
should have appreciated the wit and brightness
of this handsome brother of mine. What he did
afterward was as much ahead of my performance
as the United States of America is ahead of every
other nation in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>Which remark compels us to return to the scene
of the meeting near the cavern where Bohunkus
Johnson was waiting for the Professor to take
him on his aerial voyage to Africa.</p>

<p>Harvey was still laughing over the frenzied
flight of the colored youth when he suddenly
sobered at the fear that the inventor would follow
with his machine and pick up Bunk before he
could be prevented; but the crazy aviator did not
seem to have such a thought, for, as has been said,
he sailed straight for his workshop.</p>

<p>There was no reason for the brothers remaining
and they started after the lad, who was found by
the canoe still bewildered and scared almost out
of his wits.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>&#8220;Whar&#8217;s&mdash;whar&#8217;s de Perfesser?&#8221; he asked in a
tremulous voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you see him going back to his shop in
his monoplane?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I seed de machine but I didn&#8217;t know he war in
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose he had come here for you?&#8221; inquired
Dick.</p>

<p>&#8220;He wouldn&#8217;t hab got me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How would you have escaped him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d crawled under de canoe and stuck my nose
up on toder side where he couldn&#8217;t see me, and
breeved so soft he&#8217;d thought I was drownded.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That idea is as brilliant as most of the others
you have formed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee! if I&#8217;d knowed he was crazy I&#8217;d knocked
his head off and den run like blazes for hum,&#8221;
said Bunk, anxious to placate his friends whom
he had so grievously offended. They understood
his feelings and did not press him. Dick motioned
for the lad to take his place in the boat and the
two followed, the elder picking up the paddle
and heading for the tent where Val Hunter and
Fred Wadsworth were awaiting them with much
curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;We saw the monoplane,&#8221; said the Southerner,
&#8220;and wondered what was going on. So this is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
Bunk, is it?&#8221; he added, gravely extending his
hand to the abashed youth, who mumbled something
unintelligible. He was made welcome and
the brothers withheld all criticism in his presence.
Dick went so far as to remark that if Bunk had
had any suspicion of the lunacy of the man, events
would have turned out very differently. This
delighted the fellow, who began to appreciate the
invaluable kindness that had been done him by
Dick and Harvey.</p>

<p>He was eager to show his good will toward all
by doing the chores in camp. There was always
more or less work of that nature, such as gathering
wood for the oven or furnace or whatever it might
be called, the dressing and cooking of fish, and the
preparation of other articles for dinner. While
the lad was busy with these duties, the four young
men gathered in front of the tent, most of them
smoking, and held a conversation that was destined
to have important results.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did the Professor resent so fiercely your
keeping Bunk from him?&#8221; asked Wadsworth, &#8220;he
couldn&#8217;t have placed much value on so slow-witted
a lad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was one of the idiosyncrasies of a disordered
brain. Had he been perfectly sane he would have
cared little about him,&#8221; replied Dick.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>&#8220;I have been thinking,&#8221; remarked Hunter,
&#8220;that something ought to be done to prevent that
poor genius from committing suicide.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think the same,&#8221; added Harvey.</p>

<p>&#8220;You feel sure he intends to try to cross the
Atlantic?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is certain to make the venture unless prevented.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you hold a madman in check?&#8221;
asked Dick; &#8220;I almost regret that I didn&#8217;t send a
bullet through the tank of his machine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t have taken him long to repair the
fracture,&#8221; said Hunter.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would have delayed him several days, and
in the meantime we could lay the case before the
authorities and ask them to interfere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I doubt it,&#8221; replied Hunter thoughtfully;
&#8220;I can&#8217;t see on what ground the law could
prevent him from going on with his experiments.
Suppose he proved&mdash;what I believe is true&mdash;that
the chemical combination which he has
made will buoy his aeroplane two days or
more and that he can travel a hundred miles
an hour, what right would any one have to
interfere with him? No; there must be other
plans tried, or we shall have to leave him to his
fate.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>&#8220;What do you mean by other plans?&#8221; asked
Harvey.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be hanged if I know; can&#8217;t you think of
something?&#8221;</p>

<p>Harvey made an evasive answer; for in truth,
he was turning over a scheme in his mind which he
was afraid to make known. Dick, taking advantage
of his commanding position as an older brother,
would likely put a veto upon it. Besides, Harvey
was not yet certain he would try it even with
their assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dick,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you mustn&#8217;t forget one
thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The threat made by the Professor; he warned
you that he was not through with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Another vaporing of a disordered brain,&#8221;
replied Dick airily.</p>

<p>&#8220;None the less it must not be forgotten,&#8221;
added Hunter; &#8220;I know of the case of a
lunatic in Mississippi who was offended
by an old friend, and who nursed his revenge
for more than three years and then
assassinated his unsuspecting comrade of former
days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What can the Professor do to hurt us?&#8221;</p>

<p>Harvey recalled the incident of the Professor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
blowing up the kidnappers&#8217; cabin in eastern
Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>&#8220;He manufactures and carries at times torpedoes
of the most destructive nature. Suppose he circles
above us and drops a half dozen on our heads or
this tent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said Dick, &#8220;we should be
justified in using our rifles and I calculate we could
do it before he got in his work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He may wait till we are all asleep inside.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which makes me regret the more that I didn&#8217;t
put his machine out of commission when I had the
chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that that would have done much
good,&#8221; said Harvey, &#8220;for he could steal up to the
tent in the dark on foot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or might wait until the aeroplane was repaired
and he had gotten a new supply of fuel,&#8221; suggested
Wadsworth.</p>

<p>&#8220;The only hope, as it strikes me,&#8221; observed
Hunter, &#8220;is that in his anxiety to be off on his trip
he won&#8217;t delay to even up things with you folks.
But, as I told you, my knowledge of lunatics points
the other way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks as if we shall have a call from our distinguished
friend,&#8221; said Wadsworth, who, however
did not seem to be much disturbed over the prospect.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>&#8220;What do you advise?&#8221; asked Dick.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are two or three things we might do.
Suppose we hang round here this afternoon, taking
turns in playing chess, and not forgetting to keep
a lookout for squalls. If the gentleman comes
booming down this way, we can draw ourselves up
in line and receive him with a proper military salute.
We have Colts and a Winchester repeater, and if
we all let fly together one or two of the bullets
ought to find the bull&#8217;s eye, and we can blaze away
before he is near enough to drop any of his pills
of dynamite.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although none noticed the fact, Harvey Hamilton
took no further part in the conversation. He
was pondering over the scheme that came into
his mind some time before.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is too cunning to offer such an opening;
I gave him so good a scare with my little gun that
he doesn&#8217;t want to run against it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think he will do?&#8221; asked Wadsworth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t much fear of him; he was so cowed
that he is likely to give me a wide berth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s where you make a mistake,&#8221; said
Hunter; &#8220;we are not through with him yet; if
we do not receive a call from him between now
and to-morrow morning, I shall miss my guess.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>At this point in the conversation Harvey Hamilton
rose to his feet and yawned.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;ll leave you for awhile.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; asked his brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall walk to the home of Aunt Hep and call
upon her and Miss Harbor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t you better tarry till after our dinner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be in time to get a meal there that&#8217;s
worth eating,&#8221; replied Harvey with a smile; &#8220;you
needn&#8217;t wait for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we shall after <i>that</i>,&#8221; replied his
brother; &#8220;if you aren&#8217;t more courteous you won&#8217;t
get any supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt Hep will be charmed to have me stay
there,&#8221; remarked Harvey, who sauntered off, with
never a thought on the part of the three that he was
hiding his real purpose in thus leaving them for an
indefinite time.</p>

<p>So afraid was Harvey that his errand would be
suspected that he loitered until well beyond sight
of his friends, when he hurried his pace. He
arrived before the women had dinner ready and
it need hardly be said they were glad to see him.
In their brief acquaintance, and especially because
of their memorable ride in the biplane, he had
won his way to their regard.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going home to-morrow,&#8221; said Ann Harbor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>&#8220;Why not wait a bit longer?&#8221; asked Harvey.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been trying to coax her to do,&#8221;
said her relative, &#8220;but when she takes it into her
head to leave there&#8217;s no holding her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told paw I should not be gone long and he&#8217;ll
be real mad if I don&#8217;t git back pretty soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How would you like to have me take you in
my airship?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl&#8217;s eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh that would be splendid; will you do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I may safely promise that I can give
you the ride possibly to-morrow, and if not then by
the next day at the latest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wait,&#8221; she said, aquiver with delight; &#8220;I
was pretty well scared when we had our ride, but
you managed everything so well that I ain&#8217;t
frightened the least bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should you be? Maybe Aunt Hep will
go with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;La sakes; I&#8217;ve been thanking the Lord ever
since that my neck wasn&#8217;t broke and I&#8217;ll never
tempt Providence that way again. You will spend
the rest of the day with us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Dick; &#8220;I can&#8217;t even wait for
dinner, though if I get back in time I shall be glad
to have a meal with you.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV.<br />


&#8220;I&#8217;LL DO IT!&#8221;</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">HARVEY HAMILTON walked out to where
his aeroplane was waiting, and under the
eyes of Ann Harbor and her aunt set the
propeller revolving, mounted his seat, called a
cheery good-bye and sped away in the direction
of Dawson. He had become so familiar with the
section that there was no uncertainty in his course.
He was not heading for the town, but veered slightly
to one side, and when he caught sight of the workshop
of Professor Milo Morgan, he aimed as straight
for it as an arrow driven from a bow.</p>

<p>He was yet some distance off when he observed
the man in front of his building, bending over his
helicopter as if attending to some repair of the
machinery. When the noise of the approaching
biplane fell upon his ear, he straightened up, turned
around and stared in amazement. He stood as
rigid as a statue, never once removing his gaze
from the biplane, which lightly touched the ground,
scooted a few rods and came to a standstill less than
fifty feet from where he was scrutinizing it, and the
young aviator.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>Harvey knew the critical moment had come.
While stepping to the ground, he drew his revolver
from his hip pocket, examined it for a moment and
then shoved it back in place. This was a little
by-play meant to warn the Professor that his
visitor owned a deadly weapon and held it at
instant command. It is to be noted that the man
carried nothing of the kind. His skill as a chemist
gave him more frightful agents, though he could
not have called them into play, as the circumstances
stood, before the youth would anticipate him.</p>

<p>Harvey faced him with a smile and walked
forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, Professor; may I have a little
talk with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you come to shoot me?&#8221; asked the man,
with a terrible glare. He could not forget his
recent experience at the cavern, when he must
have believed he stood on the very edge of death.</p>

<p>&#8220;That depends upon yourself,&#8221; was the reply
in the same pleasant voice; &#8220;I call upon you as a
friend, but if you wish me to be an enemy I am
prepared.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>Throughout the remarkable interview which
followed, neither sat down, and Harvey held his
place a dozen paces away. This was prudent, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
it was uncertain what the crank might attempt.
So long as he was held off he could do no harm,
for Harvey would forestall his slightest movement.
The venomous hatred shown by him toward the
youth because of his interference warned the latter
to be on the alert, especially during the opening
moments of their talk.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a few words to say to you, Professor;
are you willing to listen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say what you please, but if you had a grain
of sense you would know better than to place yourself
in my power.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t placed myself in your power and
don&#8217;t intend to do so; don&#8217;t forget that. I wish
to speak about your trip across the Atlantic.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is too bad that Bohunkus was prevented
from going with you, but you will admit that he
has no right to leave home without the permission
of Mr. Hartley, with whom he lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What has <i>he</i> got to do with it?&#8221; demanded the
Professor, in a voice that sounded like the growl of
a tiger.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is the master of Bohunkus; if you will get
his consent, the colored lad will accompany you to
Africa; nobody else will object.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why did you and that fellow with you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
hold him back?&#8221; asked the Professor with an
ominous gleam of his burning eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have just told you the reason; we ought to
have explained and I am sorry we forgot to do so.
If you will sail down to Mootsport, see Mr. Hartley
and persuade him to say yes, there will be no more
trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t do any such thing; I don&#8217;t care about
the boy, only it made me mad to have you and the
other scoundrel try to prevent my doing as I
pleased.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We were rough,&mdash;I&#8217;ll admit it, and I beg to
apologize.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harvey was striving his hardest to win the good-will
of the lunatic. Having impressed him with
the fact that he did not hold him in fear, the
young aviator was striving to placate and soothe
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; continued the caller, &#8220;every one must
admit that you have made one or two of the most
wonderful inventions of the century. Are you
sure you can sail across the Atlantic with your
machine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; snorted the Professor, &#8220;you know
I can; why do you ask such a question?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose when you are well out over the ocean
you run into a tempest or hurricane?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>&#8220;It will take me less than two days to cross and
I can read the weather for that long; I know
better than to run such a risk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good! but you know the weather probabilities
sent out by the government are not reliable far
out at sea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not depending on the government; I shall
read the signs myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good again! But suppose some part of your
machinery breaks down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t break down; it is made too well and
has been tested too often.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or that that new kind of petrol or fluid should
run short, owing to unexpected delays?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t run short; I shall take enough to
carry me to the other side and half way back without
renewal. You talk like an idiot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is hard, Professor, to grasp your ideas,
which stamp you as the equal of Edison in some
respects. But may I offer a suggestion?&#8221;</p>

<p>This was said with so much deference that the
inventor would have had to be a much more
pronounced crank not to have been pleased. He
growled:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m listening; sometimes a fool can say something
that a wise man should heed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you have hit it. What I wish to suggest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
is that before you start eastward you give your
machine a decisive test.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have done so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But only for short distances; you have traveled
two or three hundred miles and stayed in
the air for ten or twelve hours. You know you
must do a good deal better than that in order to
reach the other side of the Atlantic.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you suppose I know all that and am
prepared for it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will pardon me, Professor, but after you
left us this morning I thought a good deal about
you and your purpose. I became worried and
could not help feeling that you were running too
much risk when you headed for Europe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because you don&#8217;t know anything
about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to be certain that you will be safe; you
are too valuable a man to throw away your life
as so many aviators have done within the last
year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t I told you I shall not throw away my
life?&#8221;</p>

<p>While this seemingly pointless conversation was
going on, Harvey Hamilton studied his man. He
noted the tones of his voice and the expression of
his face, so far as the heavy, grizzled beard would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
permit. The heart of the youth was filled with
a kindling hope at the evidence that the Professor
was mellowing. Harvey had made a favorable
impression and he followed it up with rare
skill.</p>

<p>&#8220;You say you are absolutely certain that when
you start you will reach the other side of the
Atlantic without mishap?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is not the slightest doubt. I understand
my machine better than you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not only that but a good many other facts
better than I. I am so interested in you that I am
going to ask a great favor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That before you start to sail almost three
thousand miles eastward, you travel the same
distance westward.&#8221;</p>

<p>The piercing eyes opened so wide that it was
clear the Professor did not catch the full meaning
of the remark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Travel westward,&#8221; he repeated, as if to himself;
&#8220;what are you saying?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is about three thousand miles from where
we stand to the Pacific Ocean; why not sail to that
coast and return? If you succeed&mdash;as of course
you must&mdash;no one can doubt that you will make
the ocean voyage in safety.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>The Professor still stared and Harvey elaborated
his scheme.</p>

<p>&#8220;All the way from here to San Francisco, or
any part of the Pacific coast, you will travel over
land. Of course there will be some rivers, perhaps
lakes and the Rocky Mountains to cross, but
if any slip occurs you can come down without
difficulty. On your return you will have the same
thing over again. Don&#8217;t you see what an admirable
training it will be?&#8221;</p>

<p>The response to this question fairly took away
Harvey&#8217;s breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you go with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>The young aviator cleverly parried the stroke.
Assuming a coy expression he laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;This is so sudden, Professor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he removed his eyes from the face of the
man and looked down to the ground as if considering
the question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t that be glorious? Will you really
let me go with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll start this minute if you will be my companion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Confound it!&#8221; exclaimed Harvey impatiently,
as if angered at the thought; &#8220;that brother of
mine&mdash;the fellow with the Winchester who
treated you so mean&mdash;will be sure to put in his oar. He is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
very fond of using that rifle of his and he shoots
mighty straight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What of that? We can rise far beyond range
of his weapon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then, there are my father and mother;
I don&#8217;t want the governor to have an excuse for
bringing out that hickory gad in the woodshed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why will he object?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know how a good many fathers are; they
seem to enjoy butting in and stopping the fun of
their boys. I shall have to skip down home and
get father&#8217;s consent before I dare start. I&#8217;m
awfully obliged to you, Professor, but fear I shall
have to wait till you come back from the Pacific
coast. How easy it will be for me then to go to
the governor and remind him that since you have
made the six thousand mile journey safely, he
can&#8217;t refuse to let me go with you across the
Atlantic. That&#8217;s the scheme, Professor; what
do you say to it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Professor Morgan stood for a moment in deep
thought. Suddenly he raised his head and said
with startling earnestness:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I&#8217;ll do it!</i>&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI.<br />


THE END OF THE DRAGON.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;GIVE me your hand on that!&#8221; exclaimed
Harvey Hamilton, impulsively, stepping
forward. Professor Morgan met him
half way, for he had been completely won over.
The change of mood on his part was almost incredible.
The young aviator had gained a remarkable
victory.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been so delayed,&#8221; said the elder, &#8220;that
I&#8217;m not willing to lose another minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should you? I shall give myself the
pleasure of seeing you start and wishing you the
best of luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>The inventor&#8217;s delight was childish. He chuckled
and boasted of the sensation he would cause
when, at the end of a week, he returned from the
Pacific coast, and picking up Harvey Hamilton
skim away for the other side of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you will go with me sure, young man?&#8221;
he asked, after seating himself in his monoplane,
looking wistfully down upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as sure as I secure my father&#8217;s consent,&mdash;you
may depend on that.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t forget it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Seated at the front the Professor glanced sharply
around. The package of supplies which he had
gathered at the hotel in Dawson was secured on
the seat behind him, and the controls which
governed the uplifter, the searchlight, the rudders
and motor were found in perfect trim. Nothing
remained to be done except to call a cheery good-bye
to the friend whom only a little while before he
looked upon as his most execrated enemy. Harvey
swung his cap and never were more hearty
good wishes shouted to a voyager than he sent
after the inventor, who turned his monoplane
westward, as if the course was as familiar to him
as that between Purvis and the points immediately
surrounding it.</p>

<p>The young aviator stood watching the helicopter
as it sped away, until it became only a flickering
speck in the distance and then faded from sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor man!&#8221; sighed Harvey, &#8220;I wonder if
I shall ever see him again.&#8221;</p>

<p>He never did. Somewhere in those impressive
solitudes, Professor Milo Morgan and his Dragon
of the Skies met their fate. On that summer day
in 1910, when he steered the astonishing product
of his brain toward the setting sun, he passed into
the great unknown, from which he will never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
return. He was only one of the martyrs whose
numbers must be added to before the problem of
successful aviation will be solved.</p>

<p>Now that he had taken himself out of the affairs
of Harvey Hamilton the latter stood for a long time,
wondering, speculating, hoping, and yet fearing
what the end of it all was to be. The inventor in
his haste had not even paused to close the door of
his workshop. Harvey gently shut it, but observing
no lock, he walked to his biplane and a few
minutes later was at the home of Aunt Hep, where
he had dinner with her and Ann. When he had
told his story of the departure of Professor Morgan
he made a proposal.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to surprise your brother, of the Washington
Hotel at Dawson, by taking both of you
with me. This you know will be only a call, and
I can bring Ann back to finish her visit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never can think of it,&#8221; protested the elder lady.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no need of thinking of it; come on.&#8221;</p>

<p>The good woman shook her head and remained
obdurate, but in the end she yielded; the two passengers
took their seats, and if there was ever an
astounded man it was the landlord, when the
aeroplane settled to rest in front of his hotel, and
springing lightly to the ground, the young aviator
helped out the ladies.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>Not only was the man amazed, but he was
indignant. He declared that the two had taken
their lives in their hands and done the most tomfool
thing ever known. Ann&#8217;s declaration that she
intended to return with her aunt by the same
vehicle that had brought them thither was met by
an emphatic refusal. The daughter was forbidden
ever to repeat the act, and though she pleaded and
whimpered, she was ordered into the house, there
to stay until her &#8220;paw&#8221; allowed her to step outside.
Harvey had made a mistake in counting upon the
consent of the parent. So, perforce, he bade Ann
good-bye and returned with her aunt, who was
safely deposited at her own door.</p>

<p>His next proceeding was to sail to the camp on
the shore of the lake, and rejoin brother Dick,
Hunter, Wadsworth and Bohunkus Johnson, who
as may be supposed were consumed with curiosity
to learn what the flight of the monoplane and its
owner meant. They had seen it heading to the
westward and could not guess the explanation.
They soon had the story from Harvey, who
blushed at the compliments he received.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll admit that you are ten times wiser than
your big brother,&#8221; said Dick; &#8220;for you did the
only thing that could avert the gravest peril.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There can be no question as to that,&#8221; assented<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
Hunter; &#8220;the Professor was boiling with rage and
revenge and he would have done terrible things
with those torpedoes of his.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he is out of the running now,&#8221; commented
Wadsworth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; continued Dick, &#8220;that he did not
attack you the minute you came within reach.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think he would have done so had he not seen
I was armed. I took care that he should know
that. You had already given him a good scare
with your Winchester and he had no liking for my
smaller weapon. I fell in with his views or
seemed to, and he was won over. I gave him my
promise that when he returned from the Pacific
coast I should go with him across the Atlantic,
provided father and mother consented.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A mighty safe promise to make.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Am yo&#8217; gwine to take dat trip to Afriky?&#8221;
asked the grieved Bunk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, when I can gain the permission of my
parents.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How &#8217;bout <i>me</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the same with you; if Mr. Hartley says yes,
you can go with the Professor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But yo&#8217; told me he&#8217;s crazy; how &#8217;bout <i>dat</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So he is; do you think my people will allow me
to do as you did?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>The truth filtered through the brain of the colored
youth. He held his peace and listened to what
the others said.</p>

<p>The most natural sequence of the incidents
narrated was that since none of the three had ever
ridden in a monoplane, they should decide to
indulge in the experience. Dick Hamilton, without
the least hesitation, climbed into the rear seat and
settling into position with his hands grasping the
supports, called upon his brother:</p>

<p>&#8220;Let her went!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bunk assisted in starting in the usual fashion
by setting the propeller revolving and holding the
machine back until the &#8220;auspicious&#8221; moment,
while the three who stayed behind watched the
flight, which proved more thrilling than even
Harvey expected. When only a few hundred
yards away and before much of a height was
reached, the biplane dived into an aerial pocket
or maelstrom, which came within a hair of making
it turn turtle. The young aviator had no thought
of anything of the kind, and for the instant was
unprepared. The huge wings flapped like those
of a mortally wounded bird, it reared and then
dipped on the right, until in a twinkling it stood
almost vertical. The spectators held their breath,
certain that a frightful tragedy was going on before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
their eyes. Dick Hamilton believed the same, and
held on as he had done many a time when executing
the giant swing in the gymnasium. Instinctively
he swung as far as he could to the left; Harvey did
the same, raising the right ailerons and lowering
the left, and drove ahead. It was the only thing
that could save them. As it was, when the machine
shot through the furious swirl into the calmer
stratum beyond, it still wavered, shook and leaned
over so far that several minutes passed before it
was brought back to its horizontal position.</p>

<p>Harvey glanced over his shoulder at his brother,
who smiled back, but his face was as white as a
sheet and he decisively shook his head. He did
not like it and longed to be back on firm ground.
He did not shout, but had the good sense to know
that Harvey understood the situation better than
he and would meet it as best he could.</p>

<p>In its descent the biplane had hardly touched
the earth and was still running when Dick made
a flying leap from his seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank the Lord!&#8221; he exclaimed; &#8220;I&#8217;m with ye
once again. No more for me!&#8221;</p>

<p>His friends laughed and rallied him. But he
was insistent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Terra firma is good enough for me; you may try
to reach heaven before your time, but I&#8217;m through.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>Then Wadsworth suggested that Hunter should
take the next turn. The Southerner couldn&#8217;t
rob his friend of the honor; he would wait until
his comrade had enjoyed the treat. In the end,
though, Harvey and even Bunk joined in urging
them to accept Harvey&#8217;s invitation, they sturdily
refused, because of what they had witnessed a few
minutes before.</p>

<p>Harvey stayed through the next day in camp,
hoping to overcome the fears of the two, but did
not succeed. Even Dick held out and the young
aviator ceased his urgings. He and Bunk went
on several tramps and had some hours of fine
fishing. Then they bade their friends good-bye
and headed southward down the Hudson. They
replenished their gasoline and oil at Albany, again
at Poughkeepsie, as Glenn Curtiss had done before
them, and by easy stages finally landed at their
home near Mootsport. Harvey had sent a telegram
from Albany to his father giving him the
news of the rescue of Bunk, so the arrival of the
couple was expected.</p>

<p>Bunk was distrustful as to the reception that
awaited him, but Mr. Hartley was as sensible as
his neighbor and did not utter a word of reproof.
They understood the slow-witted lad better than he
did himself.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>And here it is well to close our story. Harvey
and Bunk made other excursions, some of which
were attended by interesting experiences; but
enough has been told. Throughout the weeks
that followed all waited anxiously for news of
Professor Morgan and his helicopter, but as has
been said none ever came and as the months passed
all doubt of his tragic fate was removed.</p>

<p>Dick Hamilton returned to Yale in due course,
but secured a short leave for a visit to the Adirondacks
early in October. His heart was set upon
procuring those magnificent antlers which had been
within his grasp more than once. He hunted
persistently under the lead of Guide Akers, but
was obliged to go back to the university disappointed.
In his letter making this known to his
father he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have established one astonishing fact in
natural history: the deer and other big game in
Maine, the Adirondacks and elsewhere know
exactly when the close season ends and they govern
themselves accordingly. That buck last summer
continually got in front of me, was as tantalizing
as he could be even to the extent of grinning at me,
knowing all the time that I daresn&#8217;t harm a hair
of his hide. Now that it is the open season, you
might run a fine tooth comb from one end of Essex<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
County to the other without bringing him to light.
If I stay here until November 1, he will walk out
of the woods at sunrise, halt twenty paces away
and grin at me again. But let him beware: he
may tempt me too far.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII.<br />


BRAVE MEN ALOFT.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONE cannot help speculating upon the fascinating
subject of aviation. Its progress
during the past few years, the advancements
of every day and the certainties near at
hand lead us to wonder what kind of airship will
sail down the invisible highways of the sky in the
future. Danger incites rather than deters man
from attempts to enter the seemingly forbidden
field. Many years ago a philosopher remarked
that if a train were advertised to make the run
from New York to Philadelphia in twenty minutes,
but that it could carry only fifty passengers, of
whom one half were absolutely certain to be killed
on every trip, not a seat would be vacant when the
start was made.</p>

<p>On the last day of the year 1910, Arch Hoxsey
at Los Angeles, and John B. Moisant at New
Orleans, two of the most daring and successful
aviators, plunged to death while giving an exhibition
of their wonderful skill. This brought the
death list for the year up to forty, and more than
likely ere these lines are read the fatalities will be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
increased. None the less the development of the
aeroplane will go on: With what result?</p>

<p>Well within the present decade aeroplanes will
easily fly from the Atlantic to the Pacific; express
and mail carriers will deliver quickly their packages
to the corners of the earth; a speed of two hundred
miles an hour will be attained, so that a man
may take breakfast in New York and on the following
morning do the same in London or Paris.
An automatic stability device will render accidents
well nigh impossible; aeroplanes will become as
numerous and cheaper than automobiles; merchants
and day toilers will have their domestic
machines in which they will go to and return from
their places of business; very soon the electric
aeroplanes will be operated by wireless transmission
of power, and will become active in war, both
as scouts for the army and navy, and through their
appalling power of destruction compel nations to
remain at peace with one another.</p>

<p>No one is so well qualified to guess the near
possibilities of aviation as those who have already
been successful in that field.</p>

<p>&#8220;The air is the only element conquered by man,&#8221;
said Glenn Curtiss, &#8220;in which the speed promises
to be limitless. The improvements that are being
made daily will bring a marvelous increase in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
swiftness of travel. I have no doubt that two
hundred miles an hour will be as common as is one-fourth
of that rate on our railways.</p>

<p>&#8220;This development will be wonderfully assisted
by the army and navy. The aeroplane will be a
decisive factor in warfare. Not only will it be
invaluable for scouting purposes and for carrying
messages back and forth, but it will be an awful
engine of destruction. A fleet of aeroplanes could
annihilate New York in a day. Soaring in the sky,
safe beyond rifle or artillery range, it could sound
the last trump for the proudest and most populous
city in the world.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beyond scout duty I do not think the machines
would be of much help to the navy, but when the
battleships attack a fortified city, they could
send aloft a score or more of aeroplanes which could
blow all the forts to fragments with dynamite.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is the belief of Hubert Latham that both the
monoplane and the biplane will exist in types of the
airship of the future. He says that each embodies
essentials that are lacking in the other and that
are necessary for the proper navigation of the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;The aeroplane is perfected even more than
people think,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I could fly practically to
any place that a train can go and to many places
that it cannot go. If a good prize were offered I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
should agree to cross from Los Angeles to New
York. The airship of the future will be commercialized.
It will practically do all of the express,
mail and parcels post business. It will be the
touring car par excellence for those who wish to
see the world. It is being simplified and with an
automatic stability device which I think is coming
rapidly, it will be every man&#8217;s machine. They do
not cost much and this will be greatly reduced
during the next few years. It will make a better
race of men and women when they fly. They
will be healthier and will have a clearer idea of
things as they are. I do not look forward to any
great change in the type of machines and think
the engine and the stability device will absorb the
attention of the inventors and manufacturers of
the future.&#8221;</p>

<p>As might be supposed, Eugene Ely, the first
aviator who ever flew from a man-of-war, has decided
ideas of the coming aeroplane. He does not
believe the airship will be very effective in dropping
bombs on warships, but no one can imagine its
terrible power for destructiveness for armies and
cities. Mr. Ely said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I can carry about 350 pounds of the highest
explosive known to mankind at present. Imagine
that I was successful in dropping this explosive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
on a warship of the enemy. What would happen?
Nothing. But listen to this. In Hampton Roads
we tried the experiment of placing 350 pounds of
nitro-glycerine against the armored side of the
turret of the <i>Puritan</i>. It was set off and it was
discovered that not even the sighting mechanism
of the turret had been injured. So you see that
even if we were successful in hitting our mark we
could do little damage. But imagine this great
explosive dropped into the midst of a regiment of
soldiers. They would be annihilated in a second.
If it was dropped on the roof of a skyscraper in a
city, what would happen? It would be demolished
in a trice. So cities are at the mercy of an army
equipped with aeroplanes, and the development
will be along this line.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have seen trials of wireless transmission of
electricity and I firmly believe that the future
will see aeroplanes operated by this wireless transmission
of current, and then the greatest problem
of all, the engine, will be solved. With electric
motors we could attain a speed which sounds
foolish. We could get a lifting power from the
speed which would carry hundreds of pounds.
The machines would be made smaller and if they
had folding wings they would be no longer than
the ordinary business man&#8217;s automobile. With<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
these machines he could annihilate distance and a
friend living a hundred miles away would be his
next-door neighbor.</p>

<p>&#8220;The perfection of the flying machine will
mean a greater rural population, as has the automobile.
It will be possible and comfortable to
live a hundred miles from the city and observe
business hours there.&#8221;</p>

<p>P. O. Parmalee, who drove the Baby Wright
Flyer at Los Angeles, is certain that the coming
aeroplane will do all express, scouting, mail carrying
and will even transport light freight.</p>

<p>&#8220;With my Wright machine I can take up 500
pounds beside myself, and go anywhere that I
want to. If I double the engine capacity of my
machine and double the wing space I can carry
2500 pounds, so I think that the future aeroplane
will be a larger affair for commerce and a smaller
one for pleasure and touring. There will
probably be some sort of wing adjustment which
will enable the flyer to start from the ground with
a wide wing area, and after he has attained his
height and speed to reduce gradually the wing area
and make greater speed, and when he desires to
alight extend his wing area to its limit and land
easily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I predict that within a year a great deal of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
government mail, parcels post and express matter
will be carried to out-of-the-way places by aeroplane.
Motors are being perfected every day, and
steering and stability devices are becoming better,
so that the everyday man can soon fly a machine
as easily as he can steer an automobile. Speed
will be a great factor in the aeroplane of the future.
The Baby Wright, which was wrecked at Belmont
Park, was the fastest thing that man ever flew in.
It made ninety miles an hour and could do better.
The matter of speed has been solved for the
ordinary use of an aeroplane. It is to the lightning
service required by mail contracts that attention
is now directed.&#8221;</p>

<p>James Radley, the English aviator, is also
optimistic of the future. He says that no one can
foretell the astounding developments in aviation
that are near at hand. He believes they will be
along the lines now laid down, that is, the monoplane
and biplane. &#8220;I can only guess,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;the improvements that will come in motors and
steering. The machines are able to accomplish
much more than has been asked of them so far.
I do not think folding wings will ever be used,
since the trend is toward simplicity instead of
complicated contrivances. Automatic stability
will be attained and it will bring the solution of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
greatest problem that confronts amateurs. Within
three years aeroplanes will become as common as
automobiles.&#8221;</p>

<p>An unexpected field for their use was brought
to light at the aviation meet at Los Angeles
in January, 1911, and was suggested by the
great flight made by Eugene Ely to the
United States cruiser <i>Pennsylvania</i>. This proved
that hundreds of lives can be saved every year
by the use of aeroplanes at life-saving stations
or at government lighthouses. Multitudes have
been lost because ships have been stranded
on sandbars or rocks, where the inhabitants of
towns had no way to get a line far out to them.
An aeroplane could run ten or fifteen miles in a
few minutes carrying a reel of cord from shore
and the waves would be easily cheated of their
prey.</p>

<p>As proof of this claim the case of the <i>Czarina</i>
may be quoted. Early in 1910, that great ship
went on the bar at Coos Bay, and forty-seven lives
were lost. The air was calm and the sun shone
out, but the enormous swell pounded several lighthouse
boats to pieces and death won its appalling
victory in the presence of thousands on the shore
who were helpless to raise a hand to save them.
A biplane could easily have gone out to the vessel,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
carrying cords which would have been the means
of putting a breeches buoy into operation. Nautical
men say that if the use of aeroplanes in lighthouses
or life-saving stations is begun hundreds of lives
will be saved every year.</p>

<p>Wilbur Wright, than whom no higher authority
in aviation lives, thinks the world has grown too
optimistic about the possibilities of travel by
aeroplane. He said in Washington in January,
1911:</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be nearer two thousand years than two
when we shall be able to fly from Washington to
New York in an aeroplane in two hours. It is
almost impossible to estimate the speed that can
be attained by a flying machine. I would undertake
to build a machine that could fly at the rate of
a hundred miles an hour, but I would not want to
operate it. Many years will elapse before the
aeroplane will be used for transportation. It cannot
supply the requirements that are furnished by
railroads. Its greatest use lies in the field of
sports and military operations. Flying through
the air is a great sport and no more dangerous than
automobiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;The tragic deaths of Hoxsey and Moisant, I
presume, may retard the development of the aeroplane
to some extent, but it will go forward. Public<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
sentiment and laws will minimize the danger of
the flying machine. These influences will check
the recklessness of aviation.&#8221;</p>

<p>And now let us wait and see to what extent
these prophecies will be fulfilled.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
